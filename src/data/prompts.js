MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S BEAN...11 Hazelnut Crater Lake hazelnut espresso vodka, Kahlua, Bailey’s, cold brew, cardamom


A clear martini glass sits atop a dark bar top, filled with a dark, rich, creamy drink.  Around the base of the martini glass, should be scattered cardomom pods and coffee beans.  Next to the martini glass should be a clear smaller glass of cream.  The background should be reminiscent of Crater Lake national park.  The entire image should evoke a magical forest scene from Shakespeare's play, A Midsummer Night's Dream and be done in the Analog Film style.



LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PUREE...8 Wilderton Lustre N/A Distillate, fruit purée, lime, Club Soda


A tall clear glass sits atop a country-style wooden table, will with a strawbeery-colored, fruity, light, refreshing drink.  The background should be reminiscent of a country farm plot.  The entire image should evoke a scene from the book Little House on the Prairie and be done in the Analog Film style.
