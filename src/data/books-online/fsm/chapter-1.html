        <p>In 1977, the Oregon Legislature adopted the state’s indeterminate (parole matrix) sentencing system. Effective November 1, 1989, the legislature replaced that system with the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, a determinate sentencing system. The differences between indeterminate and determinate sentencing systems are discussed later in this chapter. Under either system:</p>

            <p>“(a) Forfeiture, imprisonment, cancellation of license, removal from office, monetary obligation, probation, conditions of probation, discharge, restitution and community service; and</p>

            <p>“(b) Suspension of imposition or execution of any part of a sentence, extension of a period of probation, imposition of a new or modified condition of probation or of sentence suspension, and imposition or execution of a sentence upon revocation of probation or sentence suspension.”</p>

        <p>Although the legislature and the Oregon electorate, subsequent to the adoption of the guidelines, approved additional felony sentencing systems, these additional systems supplement, rather than replace, the guidelines. Consequently, this manual primarily focuses on the guidelines.</p>

The chapter also provides a summary of the categories of crimes and defendants to which the guidelines apply. Following that are analyses of the guidelines’ stated definitions and the various rules used in construing the guidelines. Finally, the chapter discusses certain questions regarding the guidelines’ constitutionality and trial court authority to impose money judgments in guidelines cases.</p>

            <strong>§ 1-1. OAR 213-002-0001 STATEMENT OF PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES.</strong>
        </h1>


        <webc-oar
            references="213-002-0001"
            chapter="213"
            division="002"
            rule="0001"
            target="_new"
        >

            <p>OAR 213-002-0001 states the guidelines’ principles and purposes:</p>

            <p>(1) The primary objectives of sentencing are to punish each offender appropriately, and to insure the security of the people in person and property, within the limits of correctional resources provided by the Legislative Assembly, local governments and the people.</p>

            <p>(2) Sentencing guidelines are intended to forward the objectives described in section (1) by defining presumptive punishments for felony convictions, subject to judicial discretion to deviate for substantial and compelling reasons; and presumptive punishments for post-prison or probation supervision violations, again subject to deviation.</p>

            <p>(3) The basic principles which underlie these guidelines are:</p>

            <p>(a) The response of the corrections system to crime, and to violation of post-prison and probation supervision, must reflect the resources available for that response. A corrections system that overruns its resources is a system that cannot deliver its threatened punishment or its rehabilitative impact. This undermines the system’s credibility with the public and the offender, and vitiates the objectives of prevention of recidivism and reformation of the offender. A corrections system that overruns its resources can produce costly litigation and the threat of loss of system control to the federal judiciary. A corrections system that overruns its resources can increase the risk to life and property within the system and to the public.</p>

            <p>(b) Oregon’s current sentencing system combines indeterminate sentences with a parole matrix. Although many citizens believe the indeterminate sentence sets the length of imprisonment, that sentence only sets an offender’s maximum period of incarceration and the matrix controls actual length of stay. The frequent disparity between the indeterminate sentence length and time served under the matrix confuses and angers the public and damages the corrections system’s credibility with the public. Sentences of imprisonment should represent the time an offender will actually serve, subject only to any reduction authorized by law.</p>

            <p>(c) Under sentencing guidelines the response to many crimes will be state imprisonment. Other crimes will be punished by local penalties and restrictions imposed as part of probation. All offenders released from prison will be under post-prison supervision for a period of time. The ability of the corrections system to enforce swiftly and sternly the conditions of both probation and post-prison supervision, including by imprisonment, is crucial. Use of state institutions as the initial punishment for crime must, therefore, leave enough institutional capacity to permit imprisonment, when appropriate, for violation of probation and post-prison supervision conditions.</p>

            <p>(d) Subject to the discretion of the sentencing judge to deviate and impose a different sentence in recognition of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the appropriate punishment for a felony conviction should depend on the seriousness of the crime of conviction when compared to all other crimes and the offender’s criminal history.</p>

            <p>(e) Subject to the sentencing judge’s discretion to deviate in recognition of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the corrections system should seek to respond in a consistent way to like crimes combined with like criminal histories; and in a consistent way to like violations of probation and post-prison supervision conditions.</p>

            <strong>§ 1-1.1. Intent of Provision.</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>The commentary to this provision states: “The purposes of sentencing in Oregon and the principles that guide sentencing practices to achieve those purposes are legislative issues. This provision states the State Sentencing Guidelines Board’s understanding of those purposes and principles as provided in the guidelines enabling legislation, Chapter 619, Oregon Laws 1987 (1987 legislation).” Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual 6 (1989) (hereafter Implementation Manual).</p>

        <p>Regardless of what the legislature declared are the purposes and principles of sentencing, the Oregon Constitution states its own set of principles: “Laws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on these principles: protection of society, personal responsibility, and accountability for one’s actions and reformation.” Or Const, Art I, § 15. <em>See also</em> <span><a

The bill’s Section 1 appropriates from the general fund $1,974,379,412. Of that amount, $207,918,693 is for administrative-type functions. The Community Corrections Division’s portion of the total is $290,147,396, which is about 14.7% of the total general fund appropriation. Assuming 14.7% of the administrative-type functions are for the Community Corrections portion, the total cost for Community Corrections is $290,147,396 + ($207,918,693 x 14.7%) = $320,605,604. That leaves a total of $1,626,773,808 of the DOC’s general fund appropriation for imprisonment.</p>

            <p>Section 2 of HB 5004 specifies a non-general fund appropriation of $78,516,562. Of that amount, $53,240,720 is for administrative-type functions. The Community Corrections Division’s portion of the total is $6,441,863, which is about 8.2% of the total non-general fund appropriation. Assuming 8.2% of the administrative-type functions are for the Community Corrections portion, the total cost for Community Corrections is $6,441,863 + ($53,240,720 x 8.2%) = $10,807,602.

        <p>Scientifically based research, in the form of sociological studies, demonstrates that a “program” of extended incarceration is not “evidence-based.” This is because such a program is as likely to increase persons’ propensity to commit crimes as it is to reduce it. This scientifically based research further shows that extended incarceration can have the effect of degenerating persons’ mental health, thereby increasing their likelihood of committing crimes. Because a program of extended incarceration has the likelihood of increasing persons’ propensity to commit crimes, including by worsening their mental health, a program of extended incarceration cannot be “cost-effective.”</p>

        <p>Consider the meta-analysis of David Roodman, <em>The Impacts of Incarceration on Crime</em> at 7, Open Philanthropy Project, Sept 2017. He explains:</p>

        <p>“[T]he question of the net impact of incarceration on crime must be brought to the data. Having reviewed and revisited published analyses in unprecedented depth, my best estimate is that the best estimate of the impact of additional incarceration on crime in the United States today is zero. And, while that estimate is not certain, there is as much reason overall to believe that <span class="underline">incarceration increases crime as decreases it</span>.”</p>

        <p>(Boldface in original; underscore added.)</p>

        <p>Dr. Oliver Roeder, <em>et al.</em>, <em>What Caused the Crime Decline?</em>, Brennan Center for Justice (2015) concur. They agree that lengthy prison sentences are as likely to fail as they are to succeed in reducing crime rates:</p>

        <p>“In 2006, sociologist Bruce Western examined how incarceration influenced crime through rehabilitation, incapacitation, and deterrence. Using data through 2000, Western estimated that about 10 percent of the 1990s crime drop could be attributed to increased incarceration. To isolate the effects of incarceration, he controlled for other variables, including: spending on police, various indicators of unemployment, income inequality, racial demographics, sentencing guidelines and practices, and political parties in power. Western also made adjustments for the effect of prison on crime, which includes how prison can actually increase crime (<em>i.e.</em> upon release from prison, research shows, many individuals become more likely to commit more crime). (This effect is often referred to as the “criminogenic” effect of prison. The phenomenon of two variables that simultaneously affect one another is called a ‘simultaneity effect’ in economic analysis. * * *)”</p>

        <p><em>What Caused the Crime Decline?</em> <em>Id</em>. at 20 (footnotes omitted; emphasis added).</p>

        <p>Roeder, <em>et al</em>. explain the source of this criminogenic effect of prison: “Once an individual enters prison, they are surrounded by other prisoners who have often committed more serious and violent offenses. Upon release, they often have trouble finding employment and reintegrating into society due to both legal barriers and social stigma.” <em>Id</em>. at 25 (footnotes omitted).</p>

        <p>In sum, scientifically based research (sociological studies) establishes that a program of extended incarceration is not “evidence based.” <em>See also</em> Marc Mauer, <em>The Race to Incarcerate</em> 92-112 (2d ed 2006).

        <h3 id="veracity_principle_determinate_sentencing.">
            <strong>§ 1-1.4.2. Veracity Principle (Determinate Sentencing).</strong>
        </h3>

        <p>The veracity principle is set out at OAR 213-002-0001(3)(b). It is grounded on a “need for a sentencing system which provides truth-in-sentencing. Under the guidelines system, the sentence imposed will not be shortened by parole. The only term reductions permitted under the guidelines system will be those expressly provided by statute.” <em>Implementation Manual</em> at 7.</p>

        <p>This principle recognizes that the guidelines represented a fundamental change in sentencing policies. The former parole matrix system is an “indeterminate sentencing” system, <em>i.e.</em>, a system in which the sentencing court</p>

        <p>“a minimum and a maximum incarceration term, allowing the possibility of release on parole between the expiration of those terms; the date and conditions of release before the maximum term is generally determined by a board of parole.</p>

        <p>“This statutory system originated in the 19th Century and rests upon the rehabilitative rationale. Since the amount of time needed to rehabilitate an offender varies with each individual and cannot be known precisely at the time of sentencing, indeterminate terms give offenders an incentive to cooperate in their rehabilitation by promising them freedom when sufficiently improved.”</p>

        <p>Campbell, § 4:2, p 105 (footnotes omitted).</p>

        <p>During the pre-guidelines era, the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (then, simply called the “Parole Board”) could, and regularly did, release defendants long before they completed serving their judicially imposed maximum terms. These early releases carried a terrific political liability, which itself prompted the legislature to adopt the guidelines and to finance prison construction.</p>

        <p>Professor Kirkpatrick explains that granting early releases “created a public backlash against both the Parole Board and its matrix as defendants sentenced to prison soon reappeared in the community after serving only a fraction of their prison sentences. Thus, these early release programs gave the state corrections system the image of being a ‘revolving door.’” Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Mandatory Felony Sentencing Guidelines: The Oregon Model</em>, 25 UC Davis L Rev 695, 697 (1992) (hereafter Kirkpatrick). <em>See also</em> Kathleen M. Bogan, <em>Constructing Felony Sentencing Guidelines in an Already Crowded State: Oregon Breaks New Ground</em>, 36 Crime &amp; Delinquency 467, 474 (1990) (hereafter Bogan) (“preguidelines lengths of stay were, on the average, 24% of the judicial sentence imposed”). </p>

        <p>The guidelines system is the converse of the parole matrix system. It is a “determinate sentencing” system—one in which the court imposes sentences</p>

        <p>“whose length can be measured with relative certainty at the time they are imposed. Only credit for time served, good time, and work time can reduce the term decreed on sentencing day. * * *</p>

        <p>“Although different species abound * * * , there are two features common to all determinate sentences. First, the sentencing judge imposes a single term (instead of a minimum and maximum term as under an indeterminate system). Second, there is no subsequent parole-board decision (as with indeterminate systems) to release the prisoner earlier than the imposed term.”</p>

        <p>Campbell, § 4:3, at 110-11 (footnotes omitted).</p>

        <p>When the legislature adopted the guidelines, it simultaneously disabled the Parole Board from paroling defendants who receive guidelines sentences. Or Laws 1989, ch 790, § 28.

                <strong>§ 1-1.4.5. Selective vs. Collective Incapacitation.</strong>
            </h3>

            <p>Mass incarceration is a consequence; specifically, it is a consequence of criminal justice system policies and practices. These <strong>policies</strong> predominantly include the application of “<strong>collective</strong> incapacitation” sentencing schemes, as opposed to “<strong>selective</strong> incapacitation” schemes. </p>

            <p>“Incapacitation” is perhaps the primary rationale for incarcerating criminal defendants. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Arthur W. Campbell, <em>Law of Sentencing</em>, § 2:3 (3d ed 2004). The rationale is thought to serve the “protection of society,” which in Oregon is a foundational principle “for the punishment of crime[.]” Or Const, Art I, § 15. That principle also is found in the guidelines, whose “primary objectives of sentencing” include “insur[ing] the security of the people.” OAR 213-002-0001(1).</p>

            <p>The incapacitation rationale is grounded on the theory that “society need not fear offenders who are rendered physically incapable of committing crime.” Campbell, <em>Law of Sentencing</em>, § 2:3 at 42. “Few prisoners escape; there are few offenses which they can commit inside; and their victims are usually their fellow prisoners or custodians.” Nigel Walker, <em>Sentencing in a Rational Society</em> 164 (1972), <em>quoted in</em> Campbell, § 2:3 at 42. But owing to the “criminogenic effect of prison,” Dr. Oliver Roeder, <em>et al.</em>, <em>What Caused the Crime Decline?</em> at 20, Brennan Center for Justice (2015), in the long run, <strong>extended</strong> incapacitation may be as likely to fail, as it is to achieve, its desired goal of societal protection. </p>

            <p>As mentioned, there are two, polar-opposite types of incapacitation: selective and collective. <strong>Selective</strong> incapacitation puts incarceration to “the most efficient use,” by “restrict[ing the incapacitation] rationale to justifying imprisonment for only the most dangerous offenders, and recogniz[ing] the need for more accurate presentence studies to diagnose those types.” Campbell, § 2:3 at 43. “‘Selective incapacitation strategies offer the possibility of achieving greater reductions in crime at considerably smaller costs in prison resources[.]’” Campbell, § 2:3 at 44 n 13 (quoting Jacqueline Cohen, <em>Incapacitating Criminals: Recent Research Findings</em>, National Institute of Justice (Dec. 1983)). <em>See also</em> Ben Vollaard, <em>Preventing Crime Through Selective Incapacitation</em>, 123 The Economic Journal 262 (2013). </p>

            <p>For example, consider that an estimated “70 percent of all serious criminal offenses are committed by roughly 7 percent of offenders, a group commonly referred to as career criminals.” David W. Neubauer &amp; Henry F. Fradella, <em>America’s Courts &amp; the Criminal Justice System</em> 223 (11th ed 2014) (citing Matthew G. Vaughn &amp; Matt DeLisi, <em>Were Wolfgang’s Chronic Offenders Psychopaths: On the Convergent Validity Between Psychopathy &amp; Career Criminality</em>, 36 Journal of Criminal Justice 33-42 (2008) and Matt DeLisi, Career Criminals in Society (2005)). Theoretically, a selective-incapacitation system that unerringly targets the 7% could reduce the serious crime rate by 70%. The cost of incapacitating only that 7% would be low, but its crime-rate reductions wouldf dr be massive. Such a system would be so efficient that its inventor should be worthy of a Nobel Prize in economics.</p>

            <p><strong>Collective</strong> incapacitation is the polar opposite of selective incapacitation. It applies indiscriminately, and to far more defendants than does selective incapacitation. It is insouciant to defendants’ personal characteristics and the characteristics of their individual crimes. By imposing incarceration sentences indiscriminately, collective-incapacitation schemes lump together those who are unlikely to recidivate with the 7% who offend so frequently they account for 70% of all serious crimes.<a

                ><sup>2</sup></a></p>

            <p>“[C]ollective incapacitation policies have only modest impacts on crime but can cause enormous increases in prison populations.” Campbell, § 2:3 at 44 n 13 (quoting Cohen, <em>Incapacitating Criminals</em>). Such policies are problematic in other ways:</p>

            <p>“[O]ffenders are incapacitated only as long as their confinement lasts. Thus advocates of incapacitating prison sentences must logically endorse extremely long terms at enormous taxpayer expense. This, in turn, exposes another flaw: extended incarceration causes prolonged <strong>harm to prison inmates</strong>,[<a

            <p>Campbell, § 2:3 at 43 (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>

            <p>Literature from the criminology discipline is sharply critical of collective incapacitation. The theory “cannot provide any standards about how long a sentence should be.” Neubauer &amp; Fradella, <em>America’s Courts &amp; the Criminal Justice System</em> at 374. “[C]ritics argue that the costs of imprisonment typically exceed the benefits gained from preventing certain criminals from recidivating by keeping them incapacitated.” <em>Id</em>. at 375 (citing Argan A.J. Blockland &amp; Paul Nieubeerta, <em>Selectively Incapacitating Frequent Offenders: Costs &amp; Benefits of Various Penal Scenarios</em>, 23 Journal of Quantitative Criminology 327 (2007)). <em>See also</em> Avinash Singh Bhati, <em>Estimating the Number of Crimes Averted by Incapacitation: An Information Theoretic Approach</em>, 23 Journal of Quantitative Criminology 255 (2007). “Because recidivism rates decline markedly with age, lengthy prison sentences, unless they specifically target very high-rate <strong>or</strong> <strong>extremely dangerous offenders</strong>,<a

            <p>Mass incarceration is part of a social movement that began in the United States in the 1980s, in response to significant but transitory crime-rate increases. Oregon fully joined the movement in 1989, when the legislature replaced its <strong>in</strong>determinate, <strong>rehabilitation</strong>-based parole matrix system with its <strong>de</strong>terminate, <strong>retribution</strong>-based (“just desserts”) Felony Sentencing Guidelines. Subsequent to that adoption, the state adopted a series of additional mass-incarceration schemes (most significantly, Ballot Measure 11 (1994) (enrolled as Or Laws 1995, ch 1; codified at <a

                <span class="label">Practice Tip</span> Defense counsel should rely on criminological literature, to oppose maximized sentences based on collective incapacitation.

Moreover, this minimizing will increase economic efficiency and will reduce racially insidious externalities.

        <p>(1) The sentencing guidelines grid is a two-dimensional classification tool. The vertical axis is the Crime Seriousness Scale which classifies current crimes of conviction. The horizontal axis is the Criminal History Scale which classifies criminal histories.</p>

        <p>(2) Each grid block states the presumptive sentence for an offender whose crime of conviction and criminal history place him or her in that grid block. The solid black line dividing the grid blocks is the dispositional line. The grid is set forth as Appendix 1.</p>
        <h2 id="intent_of_provision._1"><strong>§ 1-2.1. Intent of Provision.</strong></h2>

        <p>The guidelines grid is included as an appendix to Chapter 10. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Davis,+315+Or+484&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=17866389964872013717&amp;scilh=0">State v. Davis</a>, the Supreme Court explained:</p>

        <p>“The centerpiece of the sentencing guidelines is the 99-block Sentencing Guidelines Grid. [Citation omitted.] A ‘Crime Seriousness Scale’ serves as the vertical axis of the grid. Most felonies fall within one of the 11 categories on the Crime Seriousness Scale. A [nine-category] ‘Criminal History Scale’ serves as the horizontal axis of the grid. * * * The appropriate sentence for a given felony conviction is determined by (1) locating the appropriate category for the crime of conviction on the Crime Seriousness Scale; (2) locating the appropriate category for the convicted offender on the Criminal History Scale; and (3) locating the grid block where the two categories intersect. Each grid block contains what is called a ‘presumptive sentence[.]’”</p>

        <p>Davis, 315 Or at 487 (footnote omitted).</p>

        <p>Just as the grid is the centerpiece of the guidelines, a defendant’s grid block is the centerpiece of his sentencing.

        <p>Since their inception, the guidelines have been criticized for their effect of restraining judicial discretion in favor of adhering to predetermined grid-blocks (in the vernacular, for “treating defendants as grid-blocks”).

        <h1 id="history_of_the_guidelines."><strong>§ 1-3. HISTORY OF THE GUIDELINES.</strong></h1>

        <p>The legislature’s main reason for adopting the guidelines was to link “the current and future capacity of state and local correctional facilities, serving as an instrument to measure and forecast the need for additional correctional resources.” Kirkpatrick at 695 (citing Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 2(2)(b) (in developing guidelines, “[f]actors relevant to appropriate sentencing * * * include effective capacity of state and local corrections facilities and other sentencing sanctions available”)). Kirkpatrick further explained that the legislature</p>

        <p>“viewed sentencing guidelines as a comprehensive and effective management tool for the state’s corrections system because the guidelines could regulate the utilization of all aspects of the system. To the extent the guidelines were keyed to available institutional capacity, proponents argued that the guidelines could reduce current prison overcrowding and prevent future overcrowding.”</p>

        <p>Id. at 697.</p>

        <p>The need to link felony sentences to prison capacity arose from the fact that “[b]etween 1977 and 1987, Oregon’s prison population more than doubled, with no proportionate increase in institutional capacity. Thus, prison overcrowding reached critical proportions.” Kirkpatrick at 697. When Oregon began work on developing the guidelines, its “prison system was operating at 125% of capacity[.]” Bogan at 470.</p>

        <p>The 1985 Legislature created the Criminal Justice Council. Or Laws 1985, ch 558, § 2. The legislature “charged the * * * Council with a variety of oversight responsibilities involving the state criminal justice system.” Kirkpatrick at 698-99. In 1987, Oregon had a “newly elected governor who “had committed himself to a substantial prison expansion program.” <em>Id.</em> at 697. Taking its lead from the governor, the 1987 “[L]egislature approved a bill authorizing the Council to develop mandatory sentencing guidelines for felony cases.” <em>Id</em>. at 699. But </p>

        <p>“[t]o avoid possible violation of the separation-of-powers provision of the state constitution, the legislature gave final authority to promulgate the rules to a subgroup of the Council, the Sentencing Guidelines Board. The Board consisted of members of the Council other than those who were members of the legislative or judicial branches of government. The legislature thus established the Board as an executive agency and gave its guidelines the status of administrative rules.”</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p><em>Id</em>. (citing Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 4(1)).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Kirkpatrick explains,</p>

        <p>“The legislature viewed sentencing guidelines as a rational mechanism to help assess the extent of immediate need for additional prison capacity as well as to forecast future demand for correctional resources. It also viewed sentencing guidelines as a comprehensive and effective management tool for the state’s correctional system because the guidelines could regulate the utilization of all aspects of the system. To the extent the guidelines were keyed to available institutional capacity, proponents argued that the guidelines could reduce prison overcrowding and prevent future overcrowding.”</p>

        <p>Id. at 697 (emphasis added).</p>

        <p>“some members, particularly those new legislators who had not previously had a chance to vote on the sentencing guidelines, objected to the ‘automatic enactment’ provision. Some members also felt that the guidelines should not become law without explicit legislative action. Responding to these concerns, the 1989 Oregon Legislative Assembly took action, officially approving the guidelines as promulgated by the State Sentencing Guidelines Board.”</p>

        <p>But first the legislature changed the guidelines’ effective date to November 1, 1989. Or Laws 1989, ch 790, § 6 (codified at <a

Or Laws 1989, ch 790, § 87 (legislature “approves the sentencing guidelines as developed by the State Sentencing Guidelines Board”).</p>

        <p><strong>[End Update]</strong></p>

        <p>Starting in 1993, and in most every legislative session since then, the legislature approved guidelines amendments proposed by the Criminal Justice Commission (or by its predecessor agency, the Criminal Justice Council). But the legislative bills adopting the amendments usually did not set out the texts of the amended provisions, and did not reflect how the provisions were to be amended. An example is the 1995 Legislature’s Senate Bill 429 (enrolled as Or Laws 1995, ch 520). Its Section 1 merely stated, “The Sixty-eighth Legislative Assembly approves the amendments to OAR 253-03-001[.]”</p>

        <p>To the extent the bills did not set out the texts of the amended provisions, they may have been crafted in violation of Article IV, section 22, of the Oregon Constitution, which states in relevant part states: “No act shall ever be revised, or amended by mere reference to its title, but the act revised, or section amended shall be set forth, and published at full length. in adopting the amendments.” If the bills were crafted in violation of Article IV, section 22, the amendments the legislature approved, by passing the bills, are void.</p>

        <p>The Court of Appeals rejected this type of claim in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15388383326484722255&amp;q=188+or.+app.+318&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1">State v. Norris</a>, 188 Or App 318, 72 P3d 103, rev den, 336 Or 126 (2003). The guidelines, the court held, “were promulgated as administrative rules, and administrative rules they remained, notwithstanding the legislature’s approval of them.” 188 Or App at 343. <em>But see</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=234+Or+App+637&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=16508867296458521816&amp;scilh=0">State v. Davilla</a>, 234 Or App 637, 230 P3d 22 (2010) (after holding that because the legislature’s delegation of authority to develop sentencing guidelines to an administrative body is constitutionally permissible, in that the legislature provided standards directing the development of the guidelines, ensured that its policy directives would be followed, and actually certified that those guidelines served its requisite standards, court relied on legislative approval of guidelines to reject the defendant’s claims that the guidelines constitute an unconstitutional delegation of authority by the legislative branch to the judicial branch, and that aggravating factors identified in the guidelines are unconstitutionally vague).</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, <em>Norris</em> provides a useful survey of Article IV, section 22 case law. Moreover, the 2003 Legislature’s HB 2174, which adopted the then-extant guidelines in their complete text, did not apply in <em>Norris</em>, because it was enacted after Norris’s sentencing. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals decided <em>Norris</em> before the Supreme Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Dilts+II&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=10581544603438958486&amp;scilh=0">Dilts II</a> repeated its statement from <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Langdon&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=6507668465684286200&amp;scilh=0">Langdon</a>, that the guidelines have the authority of statutory law. Consequently, <em>Norris</em> may be distinguished, and the Article IV, section 22 challenge to guidelines amendments may be relitigated in cases arising after the HB 2174’s effective date. </p>

        <p>Moreover, the <em>Norris</em> court itself identified an open question under Article IV, section 22:</p>

        <p>“An interesting question arises when the legislature actually amends the guidelines by statute and then later amends by statute that earlier amendment. Arguably, the latter statutory amendment would be required to satisfy the publication requirement of Article IV, section 22. We need not address that issue in this case, however, because neither of the two rules at issue was amended by statute and then amended again.”</p>

        <p>188 Or App at 343-44.</p>

        <p>This open question became larger subsequent to passage of HB 2174, given that bill’s enactment of the then-extant guidelines provisions in their entirety.</p>

        <p><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=226+Or+App+285&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=17548498041734591144&amp;scilh=0">State v. Pemberton</a>, 226 Or App 285, 203 P3d 326 (2009), suggests that the guidelines in are statutes. Relying on HB 2174, the court reiterated the principle that any guidelines provision “is part of the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, has been approved by the legislature, and therefore has the force of statutory law.” <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=226+Or+App+285&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=17548498041734591144&amp;scilh=0">Pemberton</a>, 226 Or at 288 (emphasis added; citing <em>inter alia</em> Or Laws 2003, ch 453, § 2). The court then relied on that principle as part (but not all) of its basis for holding that a specific <span class="underline">guidelines provision</span> controls over a general <span class="underline">statute</span>. <em>Id</em>. This is greatly significant, because administrative law principles hold that when an administrative rule conflicts with a statute, the statute controls. <em>E.g.</em>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18013360349138473557&amp;q=306+Or+134&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">Cook v. Workers’ Compensation Dept.</a>, 306 Or 134, 138, 758 P2d 854 (1988). Thus, <em>Pemberton</em> provides the basis for renewed, Article IV, section 22-based attacks on guidelines amendments that were approved subsequent to the 2003 Legislature’s passage of HB 2174. <em>But see</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3676236913400728150">State v. Newell</a>, 238 Or App 385, 390-92, 242 P3d 709 (2010) (rejecting state’s claim that guidelines are statutes, but doing so without considering court’s prior analysis in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=226+Or+App+285&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=17548498041734591144&amp;scilh=0">Pemberton</a> or the effects of HB 2174). <em>See also</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12315891853165138951&amp;q=359+or.+668&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State v.

        <h3 id="june_2023_update_4"><strong>June 2023 UPDATE</strong></h3>

        <p>Still, both <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=17599742142828415170&amp;q=357+or+619&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State v.

But the 2003 Legislature’s House Bill 2174 adopted in full the Felony Sentencing Guidelines, which established them as Oregon Session Laws. So they are <strong>not</strong> administrative rules; instead, they are Oregon Laws—<em>i.e.</em>, laws enacted by the legislature. Therefore, amending the Guidelines must be done in accordance with Article IV, section 22, of the Oregon Constitution. Amendments done out of compliance with Article IV, section 22 are void.</p>

        <p><em>As used in these rules:</em></p>

        <p>(1) “Bench probation” means a probationary sentence, which directs the probationer to remain under the supervision and control of the sentencing judge.</p>

        <p>(2) “Board” means the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.</p>

        <p>(3) “Correctional supervision status” means any form of incarcerative or non-incarcerative supervision which is served by an offender as part of a sentence for a criminal conviction.</p>

        <p>(4) “Department” means the Department of Corrections.</p>

        <p>(5) “Departure” means a sentence, except an optional probationary sentence, which is inconsistent with the presumptive sentence for an offender.</p>

        <p>(6) “Dispositional departure” means a sentence which imposes probation when the presumptive sentence is prison or prison when the presumptive sentence is probation. An optional probationary sentence is not a dispositional departure.</p>

        <p>(7) “Dispositional line” means the solid black line on the Sentencing Guidelines Grid (Appendix 1) which separates the grid blocks in which the presumptive sentence is a term of imprisonment and post-prison supervision from the grid blocks in which the presumptive sentence is probation which may include local custodial sanctions.</p>

        <p>(8) “Durational departure” means a sentence which is inconsistent with the presumptive sentence as to term of incarceration, term of supervised probation or number of sanction units which may be imposed as a condition of probation.</p>

        <p>(9) “Grid” means the Sentencing Guidelines Grid set forth as Appendix 1.</p>

        <p>(10) “Grid block” means a box on the grid formed by the intersection of the crime seriousness ranking of a current crime of conviction and an offender’s criminal history classification.</p>

        <p>(11) “Juvenile adjudication” means a formal adjudication or finding by a court that the juvenile has committed an act, which, if committed by an adult, would be punishable as a felony.</p>

        <p>(12) “Non-person felonies” are any felonies not defined as a person felony in section (14) of this rule.</p>

        <p>(13) “Optional probationary sentence” means any probationary sentence imposed pursuant to OAR 213-005-0006.</p>

        <p>The appellate courts seemingly have recognized the guidelines’ principles and purposes as part of the guidelines’ context, for they have relied on the principles and purposes to construe guidelines provisions. For example, the Court of Appeals has held that it may resolve an ambiguous provision in favor of the construction which best “provides [the public] protection from personal assault[.]” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Guthrie+1992&amp;hl=en&amp;scisbd=2&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=8432203935641603254&amp;scilh">Guthrie</a>, 112 Or App at 105-006.

        <p>If Oregon models a statute after another state’s statute, reported decisions construing the other state’s statute issued before Oregon adopted its law are persuasive in interpreting the Oregon law. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Joseph+v.+Lowery&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=11616111750373454884&amp;scilh=0">Joseph v.

        <h2 id="effect_of_guidelines_commentary_and_staff_advisories."><strong>§ 1-6.1. Effect of Guidelines’ Commentary and Staff Advisories.</strong></h2>

        <p>On several occasions, the appellate courts have grappled with the question of what effect to give commentary found in the <em>Implementation Manual</em>, or commentary and staff advisories found in the <em>Supplement Manual</em>. Although the courts have not identified where the commentary and advisories fit into the constructional template, they would appear to be part of the guidelines’ legislative history. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8538935301342032864&amp;q=325+Or.+370&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">Cf. State v. Chakerian</a>, 325 Or 370, 378-79, 938 P2d 756 (1997) (commentary to Criminal Code is part of code’s legislative history). As the Supreme Court has explained: </p>

        <p>“Authored by the Oregon Criminal Justice Council, the <em>Oregon Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual is a ‘training tool’ and ‘reference manual’ that ‘describes for criminal justice professionals the</em> proper application of the guidelines.’ <em>Guidelines Manual</em>, supra, at 1. The <em>Guidelines Manual</em> also contains the State Sentencing Guidelines Board’s official commentary to each of the rules comprising the guidelines.”</p>

        <p><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=315+Or+484&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=17866389964872013717&amp;scilh=0">Davis</a>, 315 Or at 493 (emphasis added). <em>See also</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5236420131704969440&amp;q=357+Or+145&amp;">Lykins</a>, 357 Or at 155 (explaining that the <em>Implementation Manual</em> “contains the official commentary to the Guidelines and provides important legislative history to aid our interpretation of the relevant Guidelines provisions”).</p>

        <p>In its first guidelines decision the Court of Appeals rejected certain commentary as non-authoritative. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Moeller&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=15844362449789357852&amp;scilh=0">State v.

Holliday</a>, 110 Or App 426, 430, 824 P2d 1148, <em>rev den</em>, 313 Or 211 (1992) (same). The <em>Moeller</em> court explained that one of the reasons it was free to reject the commentary was that “[t]he commentary does not have, or purport to have, authoritative status.” 105 Or App at 440 n 4. <em>See also</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Golden&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=14890302967868373199&amp;scilh=0">State v.

Similarly, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Bucholz&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=11305463448088777337&amp;scilh=0">State v. Bucholz</a>, 317 Or 309, 855 P2d 1100 (1993), the Supreme Court rejected a staff advisory. The court explained that the advisory was written after the guidelines’ adoption, so was not determinative of legislative intent. 317 Or at 318-19.</p>

        <p>But the Court of Appeals also has deemed commentary persuasive if “it accurately reflects the legislative intent.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Seals&amp;hl=en&amp;scisbd=2&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=5688442103556921038&amp;scilh=0">Seals</a>, 113 Or App at 703.

Plourd</a>, 125 Or App 238, 242-43, 864 P2d 1367 (1993), the Court of Appeals conferred authoritative status on commentary that accurately reflected certain law that pre-existed the guidelines, and that the guidelines did not change. Although they have yet to say so, it stands to reason that the appellate courts would say the same things about accurate staff advisories.</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3632527630714810225&amp;q=255+or.+app.+328&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1">Hostetter v. Bd. of Parole &amp; Post-Prison Supervision</a>, 255 Or App 328, 296 P3d 664 (2013), the court construed certain provisions of the guidelines as they were produced in 1989 by the now-defunct Sentencing Guidelines Board. Reflecting on the pertinent commentary, the court noted:</p>

        <p>“The board’s interpretation of the rules at issue is entitled to no deference, as [that] standard * * * applies ‘only when the body interpreting the rule also is the body that promulgated it.’ <em>OR-OSHA v. Don Whitaker Logging, Inc.</em>, 329 Or 256, 262 n 7, 985 P2d 1272 (1999). That is not the case here, as the rules at issue were promulgated by the Oregon Criminal Justice Council (since renamed the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission) in connection with the Felony Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See State v. Langdon</em>, 330 Or 72, 74, 999 P2d 1127 (2000) (‘Although the sentencing guidelines were created as administrative rules, the legislature approved them in 1989, giving them the authority of statutory law.’ (citing Or Laws 1989, ch 790, § 87)).”</p>

        <p>255 Or App at 332 n 3.</p>

        <p>Although this note correctly states that the now-defunct Sentencing Guidelines Board authored the guidelines, the note wrongly says the Criminal Justice Commission’s predecessor agency, the Criminal Justice Council, authored the commentary, with that commentary being the “interpretation” of the guidelines that the note references. As previously explained, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=315+Or+484&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=17866389964872013717&amp;scilh=0">Davis</a> states that the <em>Implementation Manual</em> “contains the State Sentencing Guidelines Board’s official commentary to each of the rules comprising the guidelines.” 315 Or at 487 (emphasis added). Thus, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3632527630714810225&amp;q=255+or.+app.+328&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1">Hostetter</a> ascribed authorship of the commentary to the wrong agency.</p>

        <p>In the context of the Oregon’s numerous sentence enhancement schemes discussed in this and other chapters, the question repeatedly arises: Who may serve as the trier of fact? The jury or, even without a jury waiver, the trial court? State and federal constitutional law provide subtly different answers.</p>

The <em>Apprendi</em> rule states: “Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 US at 490.

        <p>The <em>Apprendi</em> rule does not apply only in cases where the defendants were tried by juries.

        <p>The <em>Upton</em> court thus held that even as it was originally created in 1989, trial courts could have administered the aggravated-departure scheme in compliance with the <em>Apprendi</em> rule. They just didn’t know they could do it that way.</p>

At sentencing the defendant objected to use of that enhancement fact, because (i) he had not waived jury on it, and (ii) no jury had found the fact beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court agreed that it could not use the enhancement fact to impose sentence, and the state appealed.</p>

        <p>SB 528 contains three retroactivity clauses. The first clause applies the bill to prosecutions commenced before the bill’s effective date, even if the alleged criminal conduct was committed before the effective date. Or Laws 2005, ch 463, § 21(1). The second clause applies the bill to cases that have never been sentenced, but were pending at the time the bill took effect. Or Laws 2005, ch 463, § 21(2). The third clause makes the bill retroactive to cases that the appellate courts reversed and remanded for resentencing. Or Laws 2005, ch 463, § 21(3). <em>See also</em> Section 1-7.2.3. The Oregon Supreme Court has held that this retroactive application is not <em>ex post facto</em>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9590772109734549803&amp;q=State+v.+Upton&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38"><em>Upton</em></a>, 339 Or at 682-83.</p>

        <p>PRACTICE TIP: Aggravating factors are just as susceptible to pretrial challenges such as demurrers, and to trial challenges such as motions for judgment of acquittal, as are any other matters on which the jury would be instructed. Furthermore, just because aggravating factors may have been found in compliance with constitutional requirements does not necessarily mean they may be used to depart. Pre-<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Blakely+v.+Washington&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38&amp;case=16163203473167624369&amp;scilh=0">Blakely</a> case law recognizes a wide array of limitations, discussed in Chapter 7, on basing aggravated departures on factors found by the appropriate trier of fact—then, the trial court.

        <p>EXAMPLE: A jury convicts on the charged felony by a 10-2 vote, with jurors Able and Baker voting to acquit. But then, one of the 10 jurors who voted guilty on the underlying felony votes to acquit on an alleged enhancement fact. This leaves a nine-vote majority, which is insufficient to convict.

        <p>For a time, Sixth Amendment principles did not apply to factors used to impose aggravated-departure sentences, <em>see</em> Chapter 7, if those sentences served as minimum terms imposed in conjunction with greater, maximum terms. This was the holding in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8039199293870837752&amp;q=223+Or+App+644&amp;hl=en&amp;as_s">Harris v. United States</a>, 536 US 545, 122 S Ct 2406, 153 L Ed 2d 524 (2002).</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17164154724438163848&amp;q=223+Or+App+644&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State v. Stephens</a>, 223 Or App 644, 198 P3d 423 (2008), <em>rev den</em>, 346 Or 11 (2009), the Court of Appeals applied <em>Harris</em>. There, the trial court imposed 30-year indeterminate dangerous-offender sentences on multiple counts. In conjunction with each of those sentences, the court imposed aggravated-departure sentences as minimum terms. The court relied on non-juried aggravating factors to impose the minimums. The defendant argued that the trial court’s reliance on the non-juried factors violated Sixth Amendment principles. Relying on <em>Harris</em>, the Court of Appeals held that Sixth Amendment principles did not apply to the aggravating factors, because the departure sentences, as minimums, did not “exceed the prescribed [30-year] statutory maximum sentence for [each] crime.” <em>Stephens</em>, 223 Or App at 651. </p>

        <p>But four years after the decision in <em>Stephens</em>, the United States Supreme Court decided <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12405283445912662603&amp;q=See+Alleyne,+133+S+Ct+at+2160+n+1&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">Alleyne v. United States</a>, 570 US 99,133 S Ct 2151, 186 L Ed 2d 314 (2013). There, the trial court had imposed a life sentence. In conjunction with the life sentence, the court imposed an enhanced, seven-year minimum, instead of the presumptive five-year minimum. The court relied on non-juried findings to impose the enhanced minimum. The Supreme Court reversed, and did so by expressly overruling <em>Harris</em>. The Court stated:</p>

        <p>“<em>Harris</em> drew a distinction between facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the mandatory minimum. We conclude that this distinction is inconsistent with our decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey</em>, 530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and with the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an ‘element’ that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id.</em>, at 483, n. 10, 490. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an ‘element’ that must be submitted to the jury. Accordingly, <em>Harris</em> is overruled.” </p>

        <p><em>Alleyne</em>, 570 US at 103.</p>

        <p>There should be no question that <em>Alleyne</em> overruled <em>Stephens sub silentio</em>. That means that under <em>Alleyne</em>, the aggravating factors on which a trial court might rely, to impose an aggravated departure as the minimum component of a longer, dangerous-offender sentence, are subject to Sixth Amendment principles—that is, the aggravating factors are subject to the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4053038751252355308&amp;q=530+U.S.+466&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38">Apprendi</a> rule. </p>

        <p>The Upton court’s holding that nothing in the guidelines, as originally written, prohibited jury trials on aggravating factors might seem to leave intact <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Mack&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=15466068832178742283&amp;scilh=0">State v.

        <p>But <em>Upton</em> should not be so read. The court addressed a series of challenges to SB 528. These included the claim that the bill “creates a procedure under which a jury determines aggravating or enhancing factors, but does not do the same for mitigating factors, [so] it is a ‘one-sided’ rule of the type that the United States Supreme Court held to be impermissible in” <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4161923522219213499&amp;q=412+US+470&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38">Wardius v.

The court rejected this due process claim, stating: “[N]othing in SB 528 precludes a defendant from fully litigating any issue of fact properly before the jury.” <em>Upton</em>, 339 Or at 687. </p>

        <p>Thus, if a defendant shows that mitigation is an “issue of fact properly before the jury,” he must be allowed to “fully litigat[e]” it before the jury.

Lane</a>, 489 US 288, 109 S Ct 1060, 103 L Ed 2d 334 (1989). That rule is used to determine whether new, federal rules of decision may be applied retroactively in collateral proceedings. The <em>Miller</em> court held that under <em>Teague v. Lane</em>, the <em>Apprendi</em> rule may not be applied retroactively to judgments that were final before <em>Apprendi</em>’s date of decision. <em>See also</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9236378392139374560&amp;q=136+S+Ct+718&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">Montgomery v.

        <p>2 In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15840060407060192124&amp;q=Miller+v.+Alabama,+567+US+460,+132+S+Ct+2455,+183+L+Ed+2d+407+(2012),+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,48">Miller v. Alabama</a>, 567 US 460, 132 S Ct 2455, 183 L Ed 2d 407 (2012), the Court held that imposing life without parole (“true-life”) sentences on juveniles prosecuted as adults, who were not found to be “permanently incorrigible,” constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. But in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13968548909193919689&amp;q=141+S+Ct+1307&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,48">Jones v. Mississippi</a>, 593 US ___, 141 S Ct 1307, 209 L Ed 2d 390 (2021), the Court—without admitting as much—overruled <em>Miller</em>. The <em>Jones</em> Court held that so long as a sentencing court has discretionary authority to impose a true-life sentence, the court may impose such a sentence without the necessity of making a permanently incorrigible determination. (At the time of the <em>Jones</em> Court’s decision, defendant Miller’s case was pending before the sentencing court. Five days after the Court’s decision, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/alabama-judge-resentences-evan-miller-the-youngest-person-ever-given-life-without-parole/ar-BB1g7phB">the sentencing court resentenced Miller to true life</a>.) </p>

        <p>Nevertheless, the 2019 Legislature amended the aggravated murder statutes to bring them into compliance with <em>Miller</em>. As explained in the Chapter 4 Update, the statutes, as amended, prohibit imposing true-life sentences on juveniles prosecuted as adults.</p>

        <p>[<strong>End Update</strong>]</p>

        <p>But in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=128+S+Ct+1029&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=16815679881665298152&amp;scilh=0">Danforth v. Minnesota</a>, 552 US 264, 128 S Ct 1029, 169 L Ed 2d 859 (2008), the Court held that states need not follow the <em>Teague</em> rule in deciding whether new rules of decision on federal law apply retroactively in state collateral proceedings such as post-conviction relief. Instead, the Court held, states are free to develop and apply their own rules for determining such retroactivity.</p>

        <p>In light of <em>Danforth</em>, the Oregon Supreme Court wrongly decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Miller+v.+Lampert&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=2862423368180">Miller v. Lampert</a>, as well as the case that <em>Miller</em> reaffirmed, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=336+Or+379&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=3925206049191109574&amp;scilh=0">Page v. Palmateer</a>, 336 Or 379, 84 P3d 133, <em>cert den</em>, 543 US 866 (2004)<em>. See Danforth</em>, 552 US at 274 n 14 (characterizing <em>Page</em> as a “misguided” decision). <em>Miller</em> and <em>Page</em> are not <em>stare decisis</em> in state courts and should be reconsidered. <em>See</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13491379537872799485&amp;q=State+v.+Sawatzky&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">Sawatzky</a>, 195 Or App at 171-72 (declining to follow Oregon Supreme Court decision on federal question that was inconsistent with United States Supreme Court decision on same question). </p>

        <p>This reconsideration eventually did occur, during the course of which Judge Haselton’s dissenting opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=184+Or+App+577&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=2366881415337518076&amp;scilh=">Teague v.

        <p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=184+Or+App+577&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=2366881415337518076&amp;scilh=0">Teague v. Palmateer</a>, the Court of Appeals majority, like the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Miller+v.+Lampert&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=2862423368180">Miller v. Lampert</a>, erroneously held that state courts must follow the federal rule announced in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=489+US+288&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=9178485170219770923&amp;sc">Teague</a> v. Lane to determine whether new, federal rules of decision may be applied retroactively in collateral proceedings (although the Court of Appeals based its ruling on comity principles, rather than the Supremacy Clause). Judge Haselton disagreed. Cassandra-like, he argued exactly consistently with the United States Supreme Court’s later decision in Danforth “that the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=489+US+288&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=9178485170219770923&amp;scilh=0">Teague</a> retroactivity analysis does not govern whether relief for federal constitutional violations is available in state post-conviction proceedings.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=184+Or+App+577&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=2366881415337518076&amp;sci">Teague v. Palmateer</a>, 184 Or App at 594.</p>

        <p>“Rather,” Haselton continued, “our state’s post-conviction statutes themselves, and related Oregon appellate decisions, govern when, or whether, such ‘retroactive’ relief is available in Oregon courts.” <em>Id</em>. at 599. That body of law “indicates that post-conviction relief is, in fact, available ‘where the right subsequently sought to be asserted was not generally recognized to be in existence at the time of trial.’” <em>Id.</em> at 602 (quoting <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1796398796015045301&amp;q=318+Or.+352&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">Palmer v. State</a>, 318 Or 352, 357, 867 P2d 1368 (1994), but omitting certain internal quotations). </p>

        <p>For example, Haselton explained, “[W]hen a new constitutional principle has been articulated between the time of a petitioner’s direct appeal and the post-conviction proceeding, a claim based on the new constitutional principle will be considered in the post-conviction proceeding.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=184+Or+App+577&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=2366881415337518076&amp;sci">Id</a><a href="http://scholar.google.com/s">.</a> at 602-03 (internal quotations and emphasis omitted). Haselton thus concluded that retroactively raised “<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4053038751252355308&amp;q=apprendi+v+new+jersey&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38">Apprendi</a>-based claims are cognizable” on post-conviction relief. <em>Id</em>. at 603.</p>

State</a>, 357 Or 553, 355 P3d 902 (2015), the Supreme Court essentially agreed with Haselton’s dissent in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=184+Or+App+577&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=2366881415337518076&amp;scilh=0">Teague v.

As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Long</em>: </p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>“‘The touchstone is not whether a particular question is settled, but whether it reasonably is to be anticipated so that it can be raised and settled accordingly. The more settled and familiar a constitutional or other principle on which a claim is based, the more likely the claim reasonably should have been anticipated and raised. Conversely, if the constitutional principle is a new one, or if its extension to a particular statute, circumstance, or setting is novel, unprecedented, or surprising, then the more likely the conclusion that the claim reasonably could not have been raised.’</p>

        <p>357 Or at 571.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if a defendant’s judgment became final on or after <em>Apprendi’s</em> date of decision, he would be seeking prospective, not retroactive benefit, so he should be able to make out a claim under the <em>Apprendi</em>. B<em>ut see</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6985980333210561951&amp;q=414+F.3d+1025&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38">Schardt v.

        <p>But starting with its decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Harris&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_ylo=2005&amp;as_yhi=2007&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=2549740787986417177&amp;scilh=0">State v. Harris</a>, the Oregon Supreme Court’s post-<em>Blakely</em> decisions scarcely mention <em>Blakely</em> and instead discuss exactly what should be discussed, that being the <em>Apprendi</em> rule. The decisions recognize that <em>Blakely</em> does not say anything that <em>Apprendi</em> did not already say, and that instead, <em>Blakely</em> merely clarifies the <em>Apprendi</em> rule. For example, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2272997100696732751&amp;q=340+Or.+310&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Perez</a>, 340 Or 310, 314-15, 130 P3d 780 (2006), the court stated: “In <em>Blakely</em>, the Court clarified the meaning of the phrase ‘prescribed statutory maximum’ from Apprendi[.]” (Emphasis added.) <em>See also</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8133800666919340592&amp;q=343+or.+248&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Ice</a>, 343 Or 248, 254 n 1, 170 P3d 1049 (2007) (<em>Apprendi</em> “was not fully clarified until the Supreme Court explained it four years later in <em>Blakely</em>”), <em>rev’d on other grounds sub nom Oregon v. Ice</em>, 555 US 160, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009); <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Gornick&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_ylo=2005&amp;as_yhi=2007&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=6212034654455276455&amp;scilh=0">State v.

        <p>Because <em>Blakely</em> merely clarified a preexisting rule of law—<em>i.e.</em>, the <em>Apprendi</em> rule—<em>Blakely</em> does not announce a new rule of law. Only <em>Apprendi</em> announces a new rule. Because, as <em>Harris</em>, <em>Perez</em>, and <em>Gornick</em> all say, <em>Blakely</em> merely clarifies the <em>Apprendi</em> rule, limitations on the retroactive application of new rules of law in collateral proceedings do not apply to <em>Blakely</em>. The limitations apply only to <em>Apprendi</em>. That would mean that even if <em>Miller</em> is right, and <em>Apprendi</em> is not retroactive, under this clarification theory, <em>Blakely</em> is fully retroactive to <em>Apprendi’</em>s June 26, 2000 date of decision. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Accord+Frazer+v.+South+Carolina,+430+F3d+696&amp;hl=en&amp;scisbd=2&amp;as_sdt=3,38&amp;as_ylo=2005&amp;as_yhi=2005&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=7993903902711739891&amp;scilh=0">Accord Frazer v.

        <p>In cases involving offense-specific “enhancement facts,” post-conviction counsel may claim that an attorney’s failure to make <em>Wedge</em> objections to offense-specific enhancement facts constitutes inadequate assistance under the state constitution. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=673340974705931866&amp;q=159+Or.+App.+158&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">Lovelace v.

        <p>Unlike claims based on the state constitution, there is a substantial body of case law addressing whether an attorney’s failure to assert <em>Apprendi</em> objections constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel under the federal constitution. </p>

        <p>Thus, <em>Peralta-Basilio</em> may be wrong. It may be that under <em>Miller</em>, a defendant may be able to make out an <em>Apprendi</em> claim if he were sentenced on or after the date of decision of <em>Jones</em>, and even more so if he were sentenced on or after the date of decision of <em>Apprendi</em>. <em>See</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Ware+v.+Hall&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=7957085214521701529&amp;scilh=0">Ware v.

        <p>The second problem with allowing jury resentencing trials arises where the state seeks to prove offense-specific enhancement facts. Only new offender-specific enhancement facts may be tried during a sentencing phase. This is because nothing in <a

        <p>It should be noted, however, that when imposing sentence at the sentencing hearing, the court may use offense- and offender-specific facts found during the case’s earlier “trial” and “sentencing” phases.</p>

        <p>Next, on remand defense counsel also should argue that double jeopardy prohibits any sort of sentencing trial on enhancement facts. Under this theory, the only enhancement facts available for the court’s use would be those that the state proved during the original trial.</p>

        <p>Under the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause, a conviction of a lesser-included offense precludes a subsequent prosecution on the associated greater offense. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12211303413294355049&amp;q=398+US+323&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">Price v.

Pennsylvania</a>, 537 US 101, 111, 123 S Ct 732, 154 L Ed 2d 588 (2003), the Court held that factual findings subject to the <em>Apprendi</em> rule—so enhancement facts—are crime elements for purposes of double jeopardy analyses. The Court said, </p>

        <p>“Our decision in <em>Apprendi</em> * * * clarified what constitutes an ‘element’ of an offense for purposes of the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee. Put simply, if the existence of any fact (other than a prior conviction) increases the maximum punishment that may be imposed on a defendant, that fact—no matter how the State labels it—constitutes an element, and must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

        <p>“ * * * * *</p>

        <p>“We can think of no principled reason to distinguish, in this context, between what constitutes an offense for purposes of the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee and what constitutes an ‘offence’ for purposes of the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause.”</p>

        <p>537 US at 111.<a

            ><sup>8</sup></a></p>

        <p>PRACTICE TIP: Defense counsel should rely on <em>Price</em> and <em>Sattazahn</em> to argue that when the prosecution secures a valid guilty verdict on the underlying felony, but fails to secure valid guilty verdicts on any enhancement facts, what the prosecution has secured is a valid guilty verdict on a lesser-included offense, with the lesser-included being the underlying felony. The associated greater offense is the underlying felony aggravated by any enhancement facts on which the state failed to secure valid guilty verdicts. Any resentencing trial on enhancement facts, or any effort to reopen the “trial” phase to try offense-specific enhancement facts (as was done in <em>Morris</em>), should be barred, because conviction on the lesser-included offense creates a double-jeopardy bar to subsequent prosecution for the greater offense. </p>

Nevertheless, pre-<em>Blakely</em>, prosecutors could have reasonably relied on cases such as <em>Dilts I</em>, by waiting until sentencing hearings to seek to prove aggravating factors. The 2005 Legislature thus could have concluded that in all fairness, it should allow prosecutors, who relied on cases such as <em>Dilts I</em>, a post-<em>Blakely</em> opportunity on remand to prove aggravating factors consistent with <em>Apprendi</em>-rule requirements. </p>

        <p>Several due process principles apply in sentencing hearings. With respect to the defendant: “Due process * * * requires that [1] he be present [2] with counsel, [3] have an opportunity to be heard, [4] be confronted with the witnesses against him, [5] have the right to cross-examine, and [6] to offer evidence of his own.

State</em>, 190 P2d 471, 472 (Okla Crim App 1948). In a similar vein, the Kentucky Court of Appeals described the purpose of that state’s parallel statute as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>“‘[I]t contains a most solemn and vital right of the accused. Its meaning is upon the surface. It requires no reflection to understand it. It was enacted for the express purpose of giving the accused time in which to show cause against the sentence about to be passed upon him.’</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>“<em>Powers v. Commonwealth</em>, 83 SW 146, 148 (Ky App 1904).</p>

        <p>“Thus, for example, a defendant might rely on the statutory right in order to (1) consider calling witnesses or adducing other mitigating evidence at sentencing; (2) prepare for his or her allocution; and (3) prepare motions—such as defendant’s motion to challenge one of his previous DUII convictions in this case—relating to the duration, terms, and conditions of the sentence, where uncertain issues of law may be implicated.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2878080622500178375&amp;q=252+Or.+App.+85&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Dawson</a>, 252 Or App 85, 91, 284 P3d 1272 (2012).</p>

        <p>In <em>Dawson</em>, the trial court erroneously denied the defendant’s request for a two-calendar-day delay. Instead, the court allowed him only a 30-second delay. 252 Or App at 87. Rejecting the state’s claim that the defendant had not shown that he was prejudiced by the error, the Court of Appeals reversed. It explained:</p>

        <p>“[T]here also is another, more subtle, purpose instinct [<em>sic</em>] in statutes like <a
                href="#"

            >ORS 137.020(a)</a>; that is, to create a measure of distance between the sentencing proceeding and the momentum to pronounce final judgment that often exists in the wake of a criminal trial.</p>

        <p>“That concern is manifest in this case. The trial judge acknowledged that the case had had an emotional impact on him; on at least two occasions, he expressed strong contempt for defendant as a perjurer and dangerous individual. The issue before us is not whether the court’s assessment of defendant’s character was accurate. Nor is the issue whether, given more time to reflect, the court would have imposed the same or a different sentence. Rather, our focus is on the court’s disregard of an important statutory right that has existed in this state for more than a century and a half and whose purpose, in part, is to ensure the deliberate and carefully considered pronouncement of judgment in criminal cases. On the record before us, the court’s error prejudiced defendant with respect to a substantial right.”</p>

        <p>Finally, it is well worth recognizing that sentencing laws may be challenged under due process vagueness principles. For example, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-7120_p86b.pdf">Johnson v. United States</a>, 576 US ___, 135 S Ct 2551, 192 L Ed 2d 569 (2015), the Court answered a due process vagueness challenge to the so-called “residual clause” of the federal Armed Career Criminal Act. That clause applies to any felony that “involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” The lower courts applied the clause to the defendant’s prior conviction for unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun. The Supreme Court reversed on the grounds that (i) the clause ties the judicial assessment of risk to a judicially imagined “ordinary case” of a crime, rather than to real-world facts or statutory elements; and (ii) the clause leaves grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.</p>

        <p>Felony cases subject to SB 528’s requirements for proving “enhancement facts” frequently present a serious pleading problem. In a case where the defendant awaits original sentencing, the bill originally authorized the state to notify a defendant of its intent to prove enhancement facts either by “[p]leading the enhancement fact in the accusatory instrument,” or, “[w]ithin a reasonable time after filing the accusatory instrument, providing written notice to the defendant of the enhancement fact[.]” <a

        <p>“Instead, the question before us is whether defendant had an adequate time to prepare his defense against the enhancement facts alleged in this case—that is, the facts that he was on post-prison supervision when he committed the offenses and that he has been persistently involved in similar offenses.&nbsp;The answer to that question is straightforward in this case, especially in light of the fact that defendant has made no assertion to the contrary.&nbsp;Regardless, we conclude that he had ample time to prepare a defense.&nbsp;After the guilty verdict, defendant requested one week to prepare for sentencing; the court scheduled the sentencing hearing nearly two weeks out.&nbsp;The enhancement facts at issue in this case—that defendant was on post-prison supervision when he committed the offenses and that he had been persistently involved in similar offenses—are straightforward allegations for which nearly two weeks is sufficient time to prepare a defense, particularly in the absence of any contrary contention by the defendant.”</p>

        <p><em>Roberts</em>, 231 Or App at 273 (court’s emphasis).</p>

        <p>PRACTICE TIP: The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=231+Or+App+263&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=8386834660787049611&amp;scilh=0">Roberts</a> court may well have decided the case differently if the case had involved offense-specific enhancement facts, because then the facts most likely would had to have been tried in guilt phase, rather than in the penalty phase. Had that been the situation, the defendant would have had only one day before trial to prepare an adequate defense to the enhancement facts. Consequently, Roberts provides no real guidance guidance on the meaning of the phrase, “[w]ithin a reasonable time,” in the context of notices of intent to prove offense-specific enhancement facts.</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5244680610375180009&amp;q=236+Or.+App.+350&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Boitz</a>, 236 Or App 350, 236 P3d 766 (2010), the state submitted a notice of intent to prove enhancement facts, alleging that the defendant was on release pending criminal charges when he committed his crime. But at that time the defendant was on probation for prior convictions, and no charges were pending against him. He moved for judgment of acquittal on the alleged enhancement fact, and then appealed the trial court’s denial of his motion. The state then</p>

        <p>“argue[d] that the trial court correctly determined that defendant’s probationary status established that defendant was on release status from pending criminal charges. In addition, the state argue[d] that, even if proof that defendant was on probation is not proof that he was on release from ‘pending criminal charges,’ that variance was ‘not a material aspect of the allegation and was surplusage.’”</p>

        <p><em>Boitz</em>, 236 Or App at 353.</p>

        <p>The Court of Appeals rejected these arguments. It explained,</p>

        <p>“The state’s written notice provided defendant with notice of an enhancement fact that alleged that defendant committed the crimes while he was on release from ‘pending criminal charges.’ We agree with defendant that proof that he was on probation is not proof that he was on release from ‘pending criminal charges.’ Consequently, the state did not prove the enhancement fact as alleged in its notice.”</p>

        <p><em>Id</em>. at 354.</p>

        <p>With regards to the state’s alternative argument, that the variance between its proof and the allegation in its notice of intent was “not a material aspect of the allegation and was surplusage,” the court explained that the argument presents</p>

        <p>“an issue of first impression: whether a trial court could permissibly find a sentencing enhancement fact that varies in some manner from the enhancement fact alleged in the state’s notice pursuant to <a

        <p>“A defendant’s decision whether to elect to have a jury or the court determine the facts alleged in the state’s sentencing enhancement fact notice implicates similar concerns as those confronted by a defendant deciding whether to have a jury or the trial court determine the facts alleged in an accusatory instrument.”</p>

        <p><em>Id</em>. at 355.</p>

        <p>The court “[c]onclude[d] that any variance between the allegations in the sentencing enhancement fact notice and the proof at sentencing may be permissible only if it satisfies the test described in [<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=179+Or+App+1&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=16203122264413544179&amp;scilh=0">State v.

Applying that conclusion, the court held:</p>

        <p>“Under [the <em>Newman</em>] test, the variance here is not permissible. We need not decide whether the phrase ‘pending criminal charges’ is material to the state’s allegation of a sentencing enhancement fact because, even if the state is correct that the phrase does not relate to a ‘material element’ of the sentencing enhancement fact, the second prong of the test—whether the variance between the allegation and the proof caused prejudice to defendant’s defense of this case—controls the outcome of this case. Whether a variance is prejudicial depends on the specific theories under which a case is argued. Specifically, where an amendment would require a defendant to develop a different argument, the amendment is prejudicial to defendant.</p>

        <p>“Here, defendant defended against the second enhancement fact on the theory that he did not commit this offense while criminal charges were pending. Accordingly, because defendant believed that he could defeat the second enhancement fact on that theory, the amendment of the notice to excise that phrase would have required defendant to develop a different theory to refute that enhancement fact. Thus, such an amendment would have been prejudicial in this case.[]</p>

        <p>“The fact that defendant had notice that his probationary status was at issue under the first enhancement fact is immaterial to our conclusion. The issue is not whether defendant could have presented alternative theories to defeat a different enhancement fact; the issue is whether defendant would be prejudiced by a finding that differed from the language in the notice.”</p>

        <p><em>Id</em>. at 356.</p>

        <p>Finally, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2146171932880182182&amp;q=255+Or+App+594&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38">State v.

Given this lack of specificity, the Court of Appeals held that the notice did not meet the requirements of <a

        <blockquote>

            <p>“Given the statutory text in the totality of its context, it is patent that the legislature intended an ‘enhancement fact’ to be a specific thing and not—as the state would have it—an entire constellation of unspecified possible things. Accordingly, a ‘notice’ that the state ‘may’ rely on any of individual departure factors (including some ineffable ‘[o]ther’)—or any combination thereof5—is the functional equivalent of ‘That’s for us to know and you to find out.’ It is no notice at all.<br>         ____________<br>         “5 In the abstract, and without accounting for the unrestrictive nature         of ‘[o]ther,’ the State’s position embraces at least 262,143 possible         combinations of sentencing factors.”</p>

        <p>In a somewhat similar vein, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=646127219315602444&amp;q=278+Or+App+812&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State v. Teeters</a>, 278 Or App 812, 379 P3d 839 (2016) (<em>per curiam</em>), the defendant challenged the trial court’s imposition of an aggravated departure on multiple grounds, including that the court relied on one or more enhancement facts the state had not included in its notice of intent. The Court of Appeals agreed that “the sentencing court erred to the extent it relied on any enhancement fact other than those [contained in the state’s notice] to increase [the] sentence.” 278 Or App at 814. <em>See also</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17047576215171544442&amp;q=280+Or+App+43&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State v.

        <p>But there remains a fundamental constitutional problem with notices of intent to prove enhancement facts. In almost all felony cases, the accusatory instrument is an indictment. Indictments are returned by the grand jury, not by a state prosecutor. <em>See</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Gonzales&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=7212687640111209177&amp;scilh=0">State v. Gonzales</a>, 56 Or App 17, 20-21, 641 P2d 42, <em>rev den</em>, 293 Or 104 (1982) (rather than being “an investigative tool of the prosecutor,” the grand jury “is part of the judicial branch”). If the state pleads enhancement facts in a separate notice of intent, the defendant may argue that the enhancement facts may not be submitted to the jury. This is because “each aggravating or enhancing factor is a new ‘material element’ of the charged offense[.]” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Upton&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=9590772109734549803&amp;scilh=0">Upton</a>, 339 Or at 681. Indeed, in rejecting the government’s argument that the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=530+US+466&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=4053038751252355308&amp;scilh=0">Apprendi</a> rule does not apply to factual findings required to impose a fine upon conviction, the United States Supreme Court observed: </p>

        <p>“This argument has two defects. First, it rests on an assumption that <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=530+US+466&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=4053038751252355308&amp;scilh=0">Apprendi</a> and its progeny have uniformly rejected: that in determining the maximum punishment for an offense, there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact that is an ‘element’ of the offense and one that is a ‘sentencing factor.’ <em>See, e.g.</em>, 530 US at 478; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13989927396342823081&amp;q=ring+v+arizona&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Ring</a>, 536 US at 605.” </p>

        <p>This is consistent with well established law that where the imposition of [a] higher sentence may be justified because of aggravation, the aggravation relied upon as calling for the higher sentence must be charged in the indictment.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Merrill+v.+Gladden&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=13909438341101730735&amp;scilh=0">Merrill v.

        <p>Because a notice of intent is not issued by the grand jury, but instead is issued by the district attorney, the only charging instrument it possibly may be is a district attorney’s information. So although a notice of intent is not labeled an information, it serves the same function as an information, so may be labeled an “information-in-fact.” The defendant may be tried on the allegations of an information, or an information-in-fact, only if (a) he waives his right to grand jury indictment on the allegations, Or Const, Art VII (Amended), § 5(3), or (b) he is afforded a preliminary hearing on the allegations, or (c) he waives both grand jury and preliminary hearing on the allegations. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), § 5(4) and (5).</p>

        <p>It is important to recognize the fundamental significance of Article VII (Amended), section 5. District attorneys initiate prosecutions, but not without judicial review (or the defendant’s waiver of his right to judicial review). If a district attorney wishes to proceed to trial on an information in a felony case, then assuming no waiver by the defendant, the judiciary checks the charging decision by conducting a preliminary hearing. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), § 5(5). Otherwise, and again assuming no waiver by the defendant, the judiciary checks the charging decision by requiring the district attorney to present his case to the grand jury. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), § 5(3). <em>See also</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Gonzales&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=7212687640111209177&amp;scilh=0">Gonzales</a>, 56 Or App at 20-21 (the grand jury “is part of the judicial branch”).</p>

        <p>Thus, Article VII (Amended), section 5 establishes that judicial review of district attorneys’ charging decisions is part of the checks and balances inherent within the state constitution’s separation of powers. As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>

        <p>“Subsection (6) of Article VII (Amended), section 5, addresses the amendment of those accusatory instruments and provides that the state may file an amended ‘indictment or information’ when a court rules that that instrument is ‘defective in form.’ Although that text is permissive, this court has long recognized that we must read it in conjunction with subsections (3) to (5) of section 5 and that, when read together, those provisions impose limits on the power of the prosecutor. The constitutionally required roles of the grand jury and the magistrate in felony cases operate as a check on the power of the district attorney and serve a critical function in protecting individual liberties. <em>See</em> [<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=344+Or+482&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=5669116807655308146&amp;scilh=0">State v.

Freeland</a>, 295 Or 367, 369, 667 P2d (1983) (discussing role of magistrate). Thus, this court has held that, although Article VII (Amended), section 5(6), permits district attorneys to file amended accusatory instruments to correct defects that are purely matters of form, the state must return to the grand jury or a magistrate if it wishes to make substantive amendments to felony indictments or informations.” </p>

        <p>These separation of powers principles support the claim that to the extent SB 528 authorizes district attorneys to avoid judicial review of their decisions to charge “enhancement facts,” by pleading them in informations-in-fact that are exempt from preliminary hearings, the bill violates the state constitution’s separation of powers. Or Const, Art III, § 1.</p>

        <p>Finally, it must be recognized that despite these various arguments that pleading enhancement facts in a “notice of intent” without a preliminary hearing is unconstitutional, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2315520676881622046&amp;q=354+Or+98&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48"><em>State v.

The crux of the <em>Reinke</em> court’s decision is that the Oregon Constitution requires the grand jury to find and plead only the elements of the crime as defined by the legislature. According to <em>Reinke</em>, the legislature has not defined sentence-enhancement facts as elements of a crime; therefore, prosecutors may use notices of intent, without preliminary hearings, as an alternative means of notifying defendants of sentence enhancements facts.</p>

This was, however, a baffling decision. <em>Hurtado</em> held that an information followed by preliminary hearing is an acceptable substitute for indictment and meets due process requirements. 110 US at 538. Thus, one type of proceeding or the other <strong>may</strong> be used, but one or the other type <strong>must</strong> be used.

        <p>Finally, the court concluded:</p>

        <p>“The trial court in this case did, as a matter of law, have the authority to submit the alleged ‘persistent involvement’ and ‘vulnerable victim’ enhancement factors to a jury in compliance with the [defendant’s] constitutional jury trial right * * * .

        <p><em>Upton</em>, 339 Or at 688.</p>

        <p>This part of the <em>Upton</em> court’s opinion mischaracterizes the trial court’s ruling. The trial court never ruled that it lacked “the authority to submit the alleged enhancing factors to the jury”; it only ruled—albeit erroneously—that the indictment alleged Aggravating Factor D in the violation of the then-extant version of <a

            >ORS 136.765(2)</a>, which necessarily was at issue in the case, and which, by its terms, authorized submitting Aggravating Factor D to the jury, by allowing the state to allege it in a notice of intent.</p>

        <p>In any event, as mentioned, the <em>Upton</em> court decided the case by exercising the “extraordinary remedy” of granting mandamus relief. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7113876950529889849&amp;q=326+Or+607&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State ex rel Carlile v.

                data-subsection=""
            >ORS 34.110</a>, which states: </p>

        <p>“A writ of mandamus may be issued to any inferior court * * * to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station; but though the writ may require such court * * * to exercise judgment, or proceed to the discharge of any functions, it shall not control judicial discretion.”</p>

        <p>(Emphasis added.)</p>

        <p>Thus, the Supreme Court may not exercise mandamus jurisdiction to tell a lower court how to exercise discretion within its permissible range. It may exercise mandamus jurisdiction only to compel the exercise of a judicial function the court is legally obliged to perform, including by reining in a court that has acted outside its permissible range of discretion. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15088792834699755160&amp;q=317+Or+615&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State ex rel Keisling v. Norblad</a>, 317 Or 615, 623, 860 P2d 241 (1993).</p>

        <p>This means that when the <em>Upton</em> court granted mandamus relief, it necessarily concluded—as a matter of law—that enhancement facts, such as aggravating factors, are “material elements” whose inclusion in indictments is not just allowed, but is required. After all, the only issue actually before the court was the validity of the trial court’s order sustaining the defendant’s demurrer to the indictment’s allegation of Aggravating Factor D. If an indictment’s allegation of enhancement facts was merely allowed, rather than required, the trial court’s decision to sustain the demurrer would have been within its range of discretion. The Supreme Court would have lacked mandamus jurisdiction to address the matter, and to issue a decision reversing the trial court’s order sustaining the demurrer.</p>

        <p>In sum, <em>Reinke</em> and <em>Upton</em> addressed the exact same question—are enhancement facts “material elements” that must be alleged by indictment (or by information followed by a preliminary hearing)? <em>Reinke</em> says no, but <em>Upton</em>, despite its mischaracterization of the trial court’s order, says yes. Thus, the court answered the same question in polar opposite ways. </p>

        <p>The parties in <em>Reinke</em> did not address <em>Upton</em> in their briefing. Likewise, the <em>Reinke</em> court did not address <em>Upton</em> in its decision. This necessarily means that <em>Reinke</em> is not stare decisis on the question of whether <em>Reinke</em> should be reconsidered in light of <em>Upton</em> and in favor of holding that enhancement facts must be pled in the indictment (or in an information followed by preliminary hearing). <em>See</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16116926811622477424&amp;q=331+Or+38&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Stranahan v.

For example, burglary may be increased from second- to first-degree in any of four ways: (i) by proving that the defendant burglarized a dwelling, (ii) by proving that the defendant burglarized a mere building while armed with a deadly weapon, (iii) by proving that the defendant burglarized a mere building and caused or attempted to cause physical injury, or (iv) by proving that the defendant burglarized a mere building but used or threatened to use a dangerous weapon. <a

                data-subsection="(1)"
            >ORS 164.225(1)</a>. First-degree burglary is increased from seriousness level 7 to 9 by proving that the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon or caused or threatened physical injury. OAR 213-018-0025(1). If a defendant burglarized a mere building while armed with a pistol, he would be convicted of first-degree rather than second-degree burglary. <a

                data-subsection="(a)"
            >ORS 164.225(a)</a>. The state then could argue that the guidelines authorize using the defendant’s possession of the same pistol to enhance punishment for the same crime a second time, by increasing his crime’s subclassification from seriousness level 7 to level 9. OAR 213-018-0025(1)(a). <em>See also</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Minter&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=3172456014458146109&amp;scilh=0">State v. Minter</a>, 146 Or App 643, 934 P2d 585 (1997).</p>

        <p>2. Using the facts first to increase the crime classification, and then using the same facts to increase the defendant’s criminal-history score. <em>See</em> Chapter 3. An example of this is felony driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). A defendant’s first two DUII convictions within the previous 10-year period are misdemeanors; subsequent convictions within that period are felonies. <a
                href="#"
                data-action="show-ors"
                data-chapter="813"

                data-subsection=""
            >ORS 813.011</a>. Proving two or more prior DUIIs within the 10-year period increases the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony. The state then will argue that the guidelines authorize using the prior DUIIs to enhance punishment a second time for the same crime, by increasing the defendant’s criminal-history score.</p>

        <p>In each of these situations, the double use of the same facts to increase a defendant’s punishment twice for the same crime is grounds for a double jeopardy challenge. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Witte+v.+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=5421751169894487412&amp;scilh=0">Witte v.

Double use of the same facts to increase a defendant’s punishment twice for the same crime also is ripe for a substantive due process challenge on the ground that the double use is irrational. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5788419212324531915&amp;q=711+F2d+497&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48"><em>Alessi v.

Howe</a>, 26 Or App 743, 747, 554 P2d 605, <em>rev den</em>, 276 Or 555 (1976).</p>

        <p>In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1012976920634309065&amp;q=190+Or+App+532&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State v. McCoin</a>, 190 Or App 532, 79 P3d 342 (2003), <em>rev den</em>, 336 Or 422 (2004), the Court of Appeals rejected the double-jeopardy argument in the second of the circumstances described above. The court held that the felony DUII statutory scheme “unambiguously” authorizes basing a defendant’s criminal-history score on the same prior DUII convictions that were used as predicates to prove the current felony DUII charge, and rejected the claim that such double use violates double jeopardy. 190 Or App at 538. But arguably the statutory scheme in fact prohibits double use. This is because the prior DUIIs used to prove the felony element of the current felony DUII charge by necessity stem from the same criminal episode as the current charge. As explained in Chapter 3, crimes stemming from the same criminal episode may not be used to increase one another’s criminal history scores.</p>

        <p>Because the prior DUIIs are elements of the felony DUII charge, at least arguably the priors stem from the same criminal episode as the current DUII charge. This establishes that the statutory scheme at best is ambiguous about whether it prohibits or requires double use of the priors. Because the scheme at best is ambiguous, it does not make “crystal clear” that it requires double use. Therefore, construing and applying the scheme to achieve double use violates double jeopardy. <em>See</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Missouri+v.+Hunter&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38&amp;case=7184672996136280692&amp;scilh=0">Missouri v. Hunter</a>, 459 US 359, 368, 103 S Ct 673, 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983) (double use under statutory scheme is double jeopardy unless the legislature has “made its intent” to require double use “crystal clear”). <em>McCoin</em>’s contrary <em>dicta</em>, that “double jeopardy precludes the multiple use of the same facts to prove an element of the current offense and to enhance the defendant’s sentence for that offense only if the legislature intended to prohibit such double usage,” 190 Or App at 540, is erroneous, for it states the polar opposite of the double jeopardy principle from <em>Hunter</em>. </p>

        <p>Finally, even if the McCoin court was right about the felony DUII statutory scheme, that decision does not necessarily defeat the other double-jeopardy-based attack summarized above, involving first degree burglary. Moreover, <em>McCoin</em> does not at all address the due process principle at all, 190 Or App at 534 n 3, so that issue is ripe for litigation in both scenarios.</p>

Burke</a>, 334 US 728, 732, 68 S Ct 1256, 92 L Ed 1683 (1948)), Oregon has adopted several recidivist statutory schemes, discussed in later chapters of this manual, that use the defendant’s record of prior convictions, or even juvenile adjudications, as “predicates” for sentence aggravation under the recidivist schemes. Although the recidivist schemes themselves are constitutional, <em>see, e.g.,</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16833700527979484137&amp;q=358+US+576&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Williams v. Oklahoma</a>, 358 US 576, 586, 79 S Ct 421, 3 L Ed 2d 516 (1959), their use of certain priors may be subject to constitutional attack.</p>

Jacob</a>, 344 Or 181, 180 P3d 6 (2008), the court affirmed the Court of Appeals holding that a defendant could not collaterally attack a prior-conviction predicate on the ground that he had invalidly waived his constitutional right to trial by jury. But the Supreme Court went further than did the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court effectively overruled decades’ worth of case law by holding that in state courts, a defendant’s exclusive remedy for collaterally attacking prior-conviction predicates lies in post-conviction relief. The court explained:</p>

        <p>“[A] defendant [possibly may] assert that the use of a valid conviction in a later sentencing proceeding is impermissible. * * * However, where a defendant makes an argument in a later unrelated criminal proceeding that a prior conviction is constitutionally invalid, * * * [no] statute provides a basis to obtain a collateral declaration of invalidity.”</p>

        <p>Still, there may be a means of collaterally attacking priors that would be used as predicates, that being on the ground the prior was obtained in violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to counsel.</p>

        <p><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=511+US+485&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=8801393066246902030&amp;scilh=0">Custis v. United States</a>, 511 US 485, 114 S Ct 1732, 128 L Ed 2d 517 (1994) is viewed as recognizing an historical right to use a sentencing proceeding as a vehicle to collaterally attack prior conviction-predicates on the ground that they were obtained in violation of the constitutional right to counsel (in particular, the right recognized in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 US 335, 83 S Ct 792, 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963)). Thus, defense counsel should argue that the Oregon Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Jacob</em> must be harmonized with <em>Custis</em>, so as to allow defendants, at sentencing, to collaterally attack prior-conviction predicates on the ground that they were obtained in violation of the right to counsel (in particular, the right recognized in <em>Gideon</em>). <em>But see</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14682989879011704579&amp;q=363+Or+264&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State v.

        <p>Apart from attacking priors on the ground that they were unconstitutionally obtained, the recidivist schemes typically allow bench trials using the preponderance standard, rather than jury trials using the reasonable doubt standard, on the existence of priors that would be used to aggravate sentences. <em>E.g</em>., <a

            >ORS 137.079(5)</a>; OAR 213-004-0013. In cases where the defendant neither waived jury nor admitted to the existence of the priors when he pled to the indictment, these schemes are subject to attack under the Sixth Amendment principle discussed in Section 1-7.2.</p>

The emphasized text expressly states a prior-conviction exception that purports to exempt from the <em>Apprendi</em> rule the finding of prior convictions that recidivist schemes would use as predicates to enhance punishment. Consequently, the exception would allow trial courts, even without a jury waiver, to find the existence of prior convictions, and to do so while using only the preponderance standard. But for the following reasons, the prior-conviction exception is subject to federal constitutional attack. </p>

        <p>The <em>Apprendi</em> Court based the prior-conviction exception on its 5-4 decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17682294789548162371&amp;q=523+US+224&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Almendarez-Torres v.

With Thomas still on the Court, it is possible that a majority might form that would disavow the <em>Apprendi</em> <em>dicta</em>. <em>See</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12405283445912662603&amp;q=See+Alleyne,+133+S+Ct+at+2160+n+1&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">Alleyne</a>, 133 S Ct at 2160 n 1 (suggesting that the validity of <em>Apprendi’</em>s prior-conviction dicta remains an open question). <em>But see</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2427041473749885795&amp;q=550+US+192&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">James v.

        <h3 id="specific_attacksrecord_of_prior_convictionscharacteristics."><strong>§ 1-7.8.1. Specific Attacks—Record of Prior Convictions—Characteristics.</strong></h3>

        <p>Regardless of the validity of the <em>Apprendi</em> rule’s prior-conviction exception, the exception has an exception.</p>

        <p>Some recidivist schemes allow use of prior convictions, and even juvenile adjudications, as predicates only if the state proves those priors have specified characteristics. The <em>Apprendi</em> rule applies to proof of those characteristics. <em>See</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1569729417920761849&amp;q=544+US+13&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Shepard v. United States</a>, 544 US 13, 24–26, 125 S Ct 1254, 161 L Ed 2d 205 (2005) (<em>Apprendi</em> rule applies to proof of characteristics of prior conviction that must be proved in order to use prior to aggravate punishment for current crime, and Sixth Amendment jury trial principles limit proof to court documents from the prior proceedings such as the transcript, the charging instrument, and the plea petition).</p>

        <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7370112933527027740&amp;q=342+Or+711&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State v. Bray</a>, 342 Or 711, 724, 168 P3d 983 (2007) provides an example. There, the trial court relied on a non-juried finding of Aggravating Factor D, persistent involvement in similar offenses, to impose a departure. The finding was grounded on the defendant’s record of prior convictions. But the factor could be used only if the priors had certain characteristics—specifically, that the priors, in juxtaposition to the defendant’s current crimes, reflected “persistent involvement in similar offenses.” The finding of that characteristic was non-juried, so the trial court’s use of Factor D to impose an aggravated departure violated the <em>Apprendi</em> rule.</p>

        <p>Thus, Aggravating Factor D is a sentencing law that contains a recidivist system that requires proof of predicates’ characteristics, which are subject to the <em>Apprendi</em> rule. Oregon has several other sentencing laws that contain recidivist systems that, at least arguably, require proof of predicates’ characteristics. These other laws include:</p>

        <p>Oregon has several sentencing schemes that aggravate punishment in the form of sentence enhancements or multiple convictions, based on findings that certain convictions were committed in “separate criminal episodes” from the crime to which the aggravation scheme would apply. Crimes stem from separate episodes if they were not committed during the phrase “same criminal episode”—a phrase which is synonymous with the phrase “same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.” <em>See</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12518298256310522930&amp;q=271+Or+558&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38">State v.

Tooley</a>, 265 Or App 30, 333 P3d 348, rev den, 356 Or 575 (2014), the Court of Appeals applied this joinder theory, and announced a same-criminal-episode concept more expansively than ever before seen. </p>

        <p>The case involved an aggravated murder prosecution under the theory that the defendant committed two murders “in the same criminal episode.” <em>See Tooley</em>, 265 Or App at 31. The two killings took place about 12 hours apart. Preexisting case law, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Knight</em>, typically holds that crimes having that sort of temporal separation stem from separate episodes. The defendant sought judgment of acquittal of the “aggravated” element. He argued “that his objective, to ‘advanc[e] his criminal career,’ was too broad,’ ‘distant,’ and abstract—not discrete enough—to be considered singular. Defendant argue[d], additionally, that the gap in time between the murders forecloses the conclusion that his conduct was ‘continuous and uninterrupted.’” <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18118992523436245909&amp;q=265+Or+App+30&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Id</a>. at 38. </p>

        <p>The court rejected these arguments. The court instead favored the state’s theory, which urged the jury to “find that defendant spent the time in between the killings engaged in conduct that he had calculated was necessary to successfully complete, and escape culpability for, the second killing and thereby accomplish his overall objective.” <em>Id.</em> at 44. </p>

        <p>Although the court’s ruling disfavored defendant Tooley, the court’s embracement of the state’s theory would support similar defense arguments in favor of same-episode findings in cases where such findings would preclude using sentence-enhancement schemes—usually recidivist schemes—that apply only when crimes stem from separate criminal episodes.</p>

In both its original and reconsideration opinions, the Court of Appeals agreed that multiple-count charging instruments must state such allegations, so reversed the trial court’s denial of the defendant’s demurrer.</p>

        <p>More recently, in the separate case of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11652570505987944204&amp;q=364+Or+105&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State v.

        <p>Moreover, the prosecution should be required to submit a special verdict form, which would state along these lines:</p>

        <p>Do you find that <strong>[insert pertinent convictions]</strong> stem from separate criminal episodes?</p>

        <p>But a special verdict form is not the full extent of the instructions the prosecution should be required to submit. It also should be required to submit an instruction on the “judicial interpretation” of the phrase “separate criminal episodes.” <em>See</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7306155306787329924&amp;q=309+Or+523&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Nefstad</a><em>,</em> 309 Or 523, 540, 789 P2d 1326 (1990) (a statutorily undefined word is to be defined in terms of its common understanding only if “[n]othing in either the legislative history * * * or in its judicial interpretation suggests that [the word] has any statutory meaning that departs from the common understanding of the word” (emphasis added)). A definition along the lines of “’[s]eparate criminal episodes’ means that the crimes were not part of the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct” would not do, for that is not a definition at all. It is only a synonym for the phrase needing definition. <em>See</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12518298256310522930&amp;q=271+Or+558&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Boyd</a><em>,</em> 271 Or 558, 565-66, 533 P2d 795 (1975).</p>

        <p>To reflect the “judicial interpretation” of the phrase, <em>Nefstad</em>, 309 Or at 540, the definitional instruction should state the converse of the definition of the phrase “same criminal episode.” An appropriate definition should state along the lines of: </p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>The phrase “separate criminal episode” means crimes that (i) are not so closely linked in time, place, and circumstance that a complete account of one charge may not be related without relating details of the other charge; (ii) are not directed toward the same criminal objective; and (iii) do not involve the possession of multiple pieces of contraband, even if of different types, at the same place and time.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>But the defense is free to move for judgment of acquittal on the separate-episode allegation. If case law supports the separate-episode allegation, the trial court likely will deny the defense motion. But the court still must give the special verdict instruction and the definitional instruction. The court may not refuse to do so on the ground that controlling case law establishes that the convictions stem from separate episodes, for that would constitute an impermissible, directed verdict on the allegation. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2814486650249173839&amp;q=315+Or+572&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Boots</a>, 315 Or 572, 593, 848 P2d 76 (1993).</p>

        <p>Moreover, even if well settled case law supports the prosecution’s argument for a “Yes” answer to the special verdict instruction, “’the jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both the law and the facts.’” <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16449436700053353870&amp;q=253+Or+235&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Turner</a><em>,</em> 253 Or 235, 242-43, 453 P2d 910 (1969) (quoting <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=33921605022407942&amp;q=253+Or+235&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">Horning v. Dist. of Columbia</a><em>,</em> 254 US 135, 138, 41 S Ct 53, 65 L Ed 185 (1920) (Holmes, J.)). So despite the case law, the jury would be free to return a verdict of “No.” Moreover, double jeopardy would prohibit the prosecution from appealing a “No” answer. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14547606783431368553&amp;q=Smalis+v.+Pennsylvania&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">Smalis v. Pennsylvania</a><em>,</em> 476 US 140, 106 S Ct 1745, 90 L Ed 2d 116 (1986). </p>

        <p>Thus, case law adverse to the defendant does not control the jury’s answer to the special verdict instruction. This means that notwithstanding RPC 3.3(a)(2), defense counsel is free to argue for a “No” answer. In other words, even if case law would dictate a “Yes” answer, defense counsel is free to argue to the jury that the counts stem from the <strong>same</strong> criminal episode.</p>

        <p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Witte+v.+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=5421751169894487412&amp;scilh=0">Witte v. United States</a>, one of the defendant’s prior convictions, which he incurred before committing his current crime of conviction, was used to enhance his punishment for his current conviction. He challenged that enhancement, by arguing that using his prior conviction in this manner punished him a second time for his prior conviction, in violation of his rights against double jeopardy. The Court rejected that argument. Relying on the recidivist theory, the Court explained, “[A] crime committed by an offender with a prior conviction”—<em>i.e.</em>, an incorrigible offender, because his prior conviction failed to deter his new criminal conduct—“‘is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.’” 515 US at 403 (quoting <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10229866156480998197&amp;q=334+US+728&amp;h">Gryger</a>, 334 US at 732).</p>

        <p><em>Witte</em> thus held that the defendant was not punished a second time for his prior conviction. Instead, his punishment for his current crime of conviction was being enhanced because, as evidenced by the fact he reoffended after incurring his prior conviction, his prior had no specific deterrent effect on him. This lack of specific deterrent effect established him as incorrigible, so deserving of enhanced punishment relative to, for example, a first-time offender.</p>

        <p>Recidivist schemes such as that at issue in <em>Witte</em>, which use as predicates prior convictions, and even juvenile adjudications, incurred before the defendant’s commission of his current crime are “traditional” recidivist schemes. Oregon has a handful of traditional schemes. They include:</p>

        <p><strong>[End Update]</strong></p>

        <p>Of major significance, the incorrigibility concept—failure of specific deterrence—which is used in traditional recidivist schemes is inapplicable in non-traditional schemes. The prior conviction could not possibly have deterred the defendant from committing the subsequent crime, because the defendant will have committed the “subsequent” crime before incurring the “prior conviction.”</p>

        <p>PRACTICE TIP: The incorrigibility concept, which saved the traditional recidivist scheme at issue in <em>Witte</em> from a double jeopardy attack, plays no role in non-traditional recidivist schemes. Because of that, defense counsel should rely on <em>Witte</em>, and <em>Gryger v. Burke</em>, to argue that non-traditional schemes’ use of current crimes as predicates violates double jeopardy. Counsel also should rely on <em>Alessi v. Quinlan</em> and <em>State v. Howe</em> to argue that non-traditional schemes’ use of current crimes as predicates is irrational, so violates substantive due process. </p>

        <p>The Supreme Court explained that to prevail on an Article I, section 20 claim, a defendant must initially show that the government in fact denied the individual defendant an equal privilege or immunity afforded other, similarly situated citizens. An executive agency’s or official’s decision will comply with Article I, section 20 so long as no discriminatory practice or illegitimate motive is shown, and the use of discretion has a defensible explanation in the individual case. The decision will be “defensible” when there is a rational explanation for the differential treatment that is reasonably related to the agency’s or official’s task, or to the person’s individual situation. The court further acknowledged that statutes or policies providing consistent guidelines for charging decisions may be useful in guiding prosecutorial discretion and limiting the potential for treating similarly situated individuals differently. But the court concluded that the failure to adopt or to adhere to such policies did not violate Article I, section 20.</p>

        <h2 id="specific_attacksspecial_state_constitutional_provisions."><strong>§ 1-7.12. Specific Attacks—Special State Constitutional Provisions.</strong></h2>

        <p>The Oregon Constitution’s Bill of Rights has two sections that restrict trial court sentencing authority. Ordinarily defendants use these sections in an effort to avoid application of the state’s various, mandatory sentencing laws. But the Bill of Rights sections may be used as a means to avoid application of any of the state’s sentencing laws, mandatory or otherwise.</p>

        <p>The first of the Bill of Rights sections (previously discussed in Section 1-1.1), states: “Laws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on these principles: protection of society, personal responsibility, and accountability for one’s actions and reformation.” Or Const, Art I, § 15. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=184+Or+App+277&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=13303335512445438123&amp;scilh=0">State v. Kinkel</a>, the court confronted the claim that the effectively “true-life” sentence—a “string” of consecutive, mandatory sentences totaling about 112 years that the trial court imposed on a defendant who was 15-years-old and suffered from multiple, untreated or improperly treated mental illnesses when he committed his crimes but who was demonstrably amenable to rehabilitation if he received proper treatment—was unconstitutional under the principles that section 15 enumerates. The court rejected the claim, stating: “To the extent that the four criteria [of Article I, section 15] can be applied on the level of individualized sentencing, their particular significance must vary depending on the circumstances of the crime or crimes being sentenced.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=184+Or+App+277&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=13303335512445438123&amp;scilh=0">Kinkel</a>, 184 Or App at 287. </p>

        <p>The second of the Bill of Rights sections states in pertinent part: “Cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted, but all penalties shall be proportioned to the offense.” Or Const, Art I, ß 16. This provision lends itself to three types of challenges, the first of which parallels an Eighth Amendment-type challenge, which defendants base on national and even international comparisons of sentences for specific criminal behavior to determine whether a jurisdiction’s sentence for that crime is so far beyond the norm that imposing it would be constitutionally impermissible. <em>See, e.g.</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11619441780737591071&amp;q=554+US+407&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Kennedy v. Louisiana</a>, 554 US 407, 128 S Ct 2641, 171 S Ct 525 (2008) (death penalty for rape of a child violates Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause). <em>See also</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=551+F3d+875&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=9727484140801145759&amp;scilh=0">Gonzales v.

        <p>In the context of an Article I, section 16 challenge, a sentence would be constitutionally impermissible if the sentence “is so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of all reasonable persons as to what is right and proper.” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=313+Or+391&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=5915077737758307140&amp;scilh=0">State v.

Thorp</a>, 166 Or App 564, 2 P3d 903 (2000) (<em>en banc</em>), <em>rev dismissed</em>, 332 Or 559 (2001), the Court of Appeals said that in determining whether application of a sentence “is so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of all reasonable persons,” Oregon courts use the three-part Eighth Amendment test stated in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2766729709200544869&amp;q=463+US+277&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Solem v. Helm</a>, 463 US 277, 103 S Ct 3001, 77 L Ed 2d 637 (1983). Under that test, the court considers: “(1) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (2) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (3) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.” <em>Thorp</em>, 166 Or App at 571. The <em>Thorp</em> court further indicated that within that three-part test, the court considers the defendant’s background, including his criminal history (if any). <em>See Id</em>. at 578. </p>

        <p>The analysis for whether a penalty violates the “cruel and unusual” clause is not dependent on historical antecedents, such as whether cutting off a hand for theft was cruel and unusual punishment in 1776. Because morality and ethics are not static, and instead evolve through time, the federal clause looks to “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5709058278308728322&amp;q=130+S+Ct+2011&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Graham v.

Bartol</a>, 368 Or 598, 496 P3d 2013 (2021) (Duncan, J.), the court came exceedingly close to abolishing the state’s capital punishment system. The court applied proportionality principles of Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution. The court did so by mirroring the Eighth Amendment principle, which applies the “evolving standards of decency with specific marks on the way to full progress and mature judgment means that resort to the penalty must be reserved for the worst of crimes and limited in its instances of application.” <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11619441780737591071&amp;q=554+US+407&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">Kennedy v.

        <p>The foundation of the <em>Bartol</em> court’s decision is the 2019 Legislature’s Senate Bill 1013 (enrolled as Oregon Laws 2019, chapter 635). That bill severely restricted the scope of the state’s capital punishment scheme. “[A]lthough the legislature did not make SB 1013 retroactive as to sentences imposed before its effective date, maintaining defendant’s death sentence would violate Article I, section 16. Therefore, we * * * reverse his death sentence and remand the case for resentencing.” <em>Bartol,</em> 368 Or at 600.</p>

        <p>In so holding, the court effectively made SB 1013 retroactive to defendant Bartol’s sentence imposed before the bill’s effective date. The court explained:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>“[T]he enactment of the bill itself reflects a judgment that conduct that was previously classified as ‘aggravated murder’ does not fall within the narrow category of conduct that can be punished by death, as opposed to lesser sentences, including life imprisonment. Consequently, maintaining defendant’s death sentence in this case would violate two special proportionality requirements that, under Article I, section 16, apply to the death penalty: [1] the requirement that the death penalty be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution, and [2] the requirement that there be a fundamental, moral distinction between crimes that are punishable by death and those that are not. Maintaining his death sentence would allow the execution of a person for conduct that the legislature has determined no longer justifies that unique and ultimate punishment, and it would allow the execution of a person for conduct that the legislature has determined is no more culpable than conduct that should not result in death. Therefore, in light of the legislature’s enactment of SB 1013, we conclude that defendant’s sentence violates Article I, section 16.”</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the <em>Bartol</em> decision could be used in support of arguing that other legislation, which reduces sentences but does not include a retroactivity clause, nevertheless apply retroactively to sentences imposed before the legislation’s effective date. It is true that United States domestic (state and federal) law maintains that legislation that reduces sentences, but contains no retroactivity clause, applies prospectively only.<a

        <p>The second means for bringing a section 16 challenge is through a “vertical” comparison of sentences under Oregon law, <em>i.e.</em>, comparing the sentence for a lesser-included offense with the sentence for the greater offense.

        <p>Until recently in state history, successful challenges under section 16 have been strictly limited to vertical analyses. That changed when the Supreme Court decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=347+Or+46&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=15869527206720165540&amp;scilh=0">State v. Rodriguez/Buck</a>. There, the courts confronted the claim that section 16 prohibited imposing 75-month minimum sentences state sentencing law mandated for the defendants’ first-degree sexual abuse convictions. The trial courts accepted the defendants’ claims, and imposed lesser, presumptive guidelines sentences. The Court of Appeals reversed. On a 4-3 vote, the Supreme Court&nbsp;reversed the Court of Appeals and affirmed the trial courts’ decisions. <em>See also</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5661259847214360651&amp;q=360+Or+370&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State v. Davidson</a>, 360 Or 370, 380 P3d 963 (2016) (where defendant, previously convicted of multiple, felony-grade public indecency convictions, incurred “true-life” sentences for two more felony-grade public indecency convictions, the court, after considering defendant’s criminal history for only low level offenses and comparing defendant’s crime to far more serious crimes that carry true-life sentences, held that imposing true-life sentences on defendant was unconstitutionally disproportionate); <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5703588097461991550&amp;q=293+Or+App+611&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State v.

        <p>The <em>Rodriguez/Buck</em> court established the third means for bringing a section 16 challenge. The court explained that to decide section 16 proportionality claims, the court “examines [i] the relationship between the severity of the penalty and the gravity of the offense, including consideration of the particular conduct of the defendant that constituted the offense.&nbsp;We also consider [ii] the penalties imposed for other crimes and [iii] the defendant’s criminal history.” <em>Rodriguez/Buck</em>, 347 Or at 79 (emphasis added).</p>

        <p>Addressing the first consideration, the court explained that both defendants’ convictions were based on facts that were “at the outer edge of” the type of conduct required for first-degree sexual abuse convictions. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=347+Or+46&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=15869527206720165540&amp;scilh=0">Id.</a> at 75. Regarding the third consideration, neither defendant had any criminal history. <em>Id</em>. at 73-78.</p>

        <p>But perhaps the most significant feature of the court’s opinion is found in the phrase emphasized above, “for other crimes.” For the first time, the court did not base a favorable proportionality decision strictly on a “vertical” comparison of sentences. Instead, the court also based its decisions on a type of “horizontal” comparison, by considering the Measure 11 minimum for first-degree sexual abuse against “the penalties imposed for other crimes that have similar characteristics to the crime at issue”; specifically, the second-degree versions of rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse. <em>Id.</em> at 75. The court explained:</p>

        <p>“[N]othing in the concept of proportionality in criminal sentencing suggests that the only ‘proportion’ that should be considered is the relationship between the crime for which the defendant was convicted and the punishment for that crime.&nbsp;Indeed, a standard that considers the offense and the penalty at issue in the context of related offenses and penalties provides a closer connection to the manner in which the substantive criminal laws and the sentencing statutes work together—and to what would, or would not, ‘shock the moral sense’ of reasonable people—than the purely abstract comparison of any single offense and the penalty for that offense.”</p>

        <p><em>Id.</em> at 64-65.</p>

        <p>However, this part of the analysis does not involve comparing aggregate sentences—consecutive sentences for multiple convictions—with the sentence for a single crime. Thus, the court rejected the defendant’s claim, which he based on a comparison of his consecutive 119-month “sentence for 10 counts of first-degree encouraging child sex abuse to the [100-month] sentence for [the] single related crime” of first-degree rape. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1717903224985581240&amp;q=259+Or+App+547&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State v. Parker</a>, 259 Or App 547, 553, 314 P3d 980 (2013), <em>rev den</em>, 355 Or 380 (2014). After conducting the appropriate examination, the court concluded that the “considerations” that guide proportionality analyses</p>

        <p>“lead us * * * to conclude that these cases present the rare circumstance in which the statutorily prescribed penalty is so disproportionate to the offenses committed by these defendants that it ‘shocks the moral sense’ of reasonable people.&nbsp;Accordingly, 75-month sentences, as applied to defendants here, would violate Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution.”</p>

        <p><em>Id.</em> at 79.</p>

        <p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=231+Or+App+11&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=17493697063374674828&amp;scilh=0">State v. Alwinger</a>, 231 Or App 11, 217 P3d (2009), <em>on recons</em>, 236 Or App 240, 236 P3d 755 (2010), the defendant brought a proportionality claim against the 25-year mandatory minimum for a sexual offense committed against a child, specified by <a

                data-subsection="(D)"
            >ORS 137.700(D)</a>-(F). Among other things, the defendant based his claim on the fact that his mandatory minimum for a non-homicide offense was equal to the mandatory minimum for murder. <em>See</em> <a
                href="#"
                data-action="show-ors"

                data-subsection="(A)"
            >ORS 137.700(A)</a>.</p>

        <p>In its original opinion, the Court of Appeals rejected that claim on the ground that it was impermissibly based on a “horizontal” comparison. After the Supreme Court held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=347+Or+46&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=15869527206720165540&amp;scilh=0">Rodriguez/Buck</a> that such comparisons are permissible, the Court of Appeals concluded that it must reconsider its original decision. <em>See Alwinger,</em> 236 Or App at 242. The court reaffirmed that decision on the ground that although the minimum terms for murder and certain child-sex offenses might be equal, unlike the child-sex offenses, murder carries a mandatory indeterminate term of life, which the Board of Parole &amp; Post-Prison Supervision might not set aside after the murderer completes his 25-year minimum. <em>See Id.</em> at 246.</p>

        <p>Alwinger thus establishes that how a defendant will be treated later, while he is in prison serving his sentence, may be considered in a proportionality analysis. This provides the possibility of relying on the expected nature of a defendant’s imprisonment as the basis for a renewed proportionality claim against the 25-year mandatory minimum for certain child sex offenses.</p>

        <p>Publications such as Ethan Hoffman &amp; John McCoy, <em>Concrete Mama: Prison Profiles from Walla Walla</em> (1986), provide insight into the likely nature of how pedophiles will be treated in prison. They regularly are victims of extortion. For example, fellow inmates may require them to pay “taxes” just to survive in general population in relative safety. Not infrequently, fellow inmates will assault, and even sexually assault, pedophiles. Sometimes pedophiles will feel compelled to “marry” fellow inmates who will protect them from other inmates. Although that requires a pedophile to become his fellow inmate’s “herm” (her + him), the idea is that it is better to be sexually assaulted by one inmate, rather than by several. To avoid the deplorable treatment that pedophiles receive at the hands of fellow inmates, pedophiles often check into protective custody where they live in mind-crushing isolation. Not surprisingly, pedophiles have high rates of suicide. Even if they do survive their time in prison, they leave broken beyond repair, so have little or no life left anyway.</p>

        <p>A record made in reliance on the Court of Appeals reconsideration opinion in <em>Alwinger</em>, documenting how a pedophile will be treated while in prison, could persuade the courts that notwithstanding the indeterminate life sentence that accompanies a 25-year minimum for murder, a child-sex offender’s 25-year sentence is far worse than a murder sentence. Indeed, owing to the high suicide rate among pedophiles, it could be argued that the treatment that pedophiles endure while in prison establishes that a 25-year mandatory minimum is a “fate worse than death.” If successful, this argument would establish that the sentence for the non-homicide crime actually is worse than a homicide crime.</p>

        <p>Thus, creating a record that demonstrates the nature of imprisonment for murder offenders, as opposed to pedophiles, could serve as the basis for a renewed proportionality attack against the 25-year mandatory minimum for certain child-sex offenses.</p>

        <p>For other than hit-and-run convictions for crimes committed on or after January 1, 2004, the court is not required to consider a defendant’s ability to pay. Or Laws 2003, ch 670. For those cases, the law specifies in relevant part that the</p>

        <p>“court may delay the enforcement of the monetary sanctions, including restitution, only if the defendant alleges and establishes to the satisfaction of the court the defendant’s inability to pay the judgment in full at the time the judgment is entered. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay, the court may establish or allow an appropriate supervising authority to establish a payment schedule, taking into consideration the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the defendant.”</p>

        <p>When it determines whether a defendant has established that he “is unable to pay” restitution, a court must be mindful of Article I, section 19 of the Oregon Constitution, which precludes “imprisonment for debt, except in the case of fraud or absconding debtors.” The court also must be mindful of the mandate of the Equal Protection Clause, that criminal judgment debtors be afforded the same protections as civil judgment debtors. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9543590519617312467&amp;q=407+US+128&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38">James v.

There, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals, and held that the combination of a paid automobile repair bill, Blue Book value, a detailed repair estimate, and photographs of damage supported reasonableness of the restitution award.</p>

        <p>Along similar lines, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15491833652805433792&amp;q=304+Or+App+163&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State v. De Verteuil</a>, 304 Or App 163, 467 P3d 80 (2020), the trial court awarded restitution for the defendant’s destruction of the victim’s car seat and roof rack. The trial court based the restitution amount on what the victim had originally paid for those items in new condition. The Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the trial court “incorrectly award[ed] the original purchase price of the items as new items without any depreciation for their value at the time and place that defendant’s criminal conduct destroyed those items.” 304 Or App at 170.</p>

But the Supreme Court expressly addressed whether the trial court validly imposed restitution for costs incurred by the victim to hire a civil attorney to represent the victim during the state’s prosecution of a defendant in a criminal trial.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court explained:</p>
        <blockquote>

            <p>“Under the American Rule, if a victim of a crime were to file a civil action to recover for the injuries and resulting economic damages that the victim suffered at the hands of the criminal defendant, the victim would not be entitled to recover the attorney fees incurred in that civil proceeding unless permitted by statute or contract.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>370 Or at 468.</p>

        <p>The court then “conclude[d] that the legislature did not intend to permit courts to award, as ‘economic damages,’ the attorney fees that a victim chooses to incur in a criminal case to protect their interest in obtaining an award of restitution.” <em>Id</em>. at 469. The court then “conclude[d] that, in this case, the trial court erred in awarding the resulting attorney fees as restitution.” <em>Id.</em> at 470.</p>

Gastiaburu</a>, 318 Or App 454, 508 P3d 592 (2022), the defendant appealed a supplemental judgment ordering her to pay restitution for medical expenses to the victim’s health insurer and Oregon Department of Justice Crime Victims’ Compensation (CVC). At the restitution hearing, the state presented evidence that the health insurer and CVC paid for various medical expenses at an amount less than they were billed. On appeal, defendant challenged the restitution awards, contending that the evidence was legally insufficient that the medical expenses were reasonable. The Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred. The evidence was legally insufficient to support the restitution awards to the victim’s health insurer and CVC, because the evidence did not demonstrate how the amounts paid by the health insurer and CVC corresponded to market rates and, therefore, did not demonstrate that the amounts paid by the health insurer and CVC were at or below market rates. The Court of Appeals reversed the supplemental judgment in part and remanded for resentencing.</p>

Instead, our decisions broadly prohibit judicial factfinding that increases maximum criminal ‘sentence[s],’ ‘penalties,’ or ‘punishment[s]’—terms that each undeniably embrace fines. <em>E.g.</em>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16163203473167624369&amp;q=blakely+v+washington&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38">Blakely</a>, 542 US at 304; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=530+US+466&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=4053038751252355308&amp;scilh=0">Apprendi</a>, 530 US at 490; Ring, 536 US at 589.”</p>

        <p>Whether the principle from <em>Southern Union</em> will apply to other money judgments that require fact finding, such as restitution, remains to be seen. <em>See</em> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Mendez&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=12424584753937515628&amp;scilh=0">State v. Mendez</a>, 211 Or App 311, 155 P3d 54 (2007) (where jury found defendant guilty of criminal mischief, by causing damage of no more than $1,000.00, trial court did not violate Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution by imposing restitution of $1,665.59). <em>But see</em> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11917902093835186099&amp;q=277+Or+App+288&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v.
